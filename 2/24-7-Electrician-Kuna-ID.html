Utility companies incur significant upfront costs to start supplying utility services by purchasing power and water equipment and installing a distribution network. If the power demand for a circuit approaches the amps the circuit is rated for, the circuit breaker will trip and shut down power to the circuit, because there is a danger of the wiring overheating.</p>
<p>Electricians may need to take classes to learn about changes to the National Electrical Code, and they often complete regular safety programs, manufacturer-specific training, and management training courses. A joule rating of at least 600 should be able to handle most household surges. Important note: NEVER increase the size of a panel breaker on a circuit that keeps tripping. When looking at the green screw of the receptacle terminal, it should be connected to a metal box or electrical box.</p>
