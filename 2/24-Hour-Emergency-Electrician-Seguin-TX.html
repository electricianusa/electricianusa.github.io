I have installed 1,000's of outdoor lighting systems for almost 30 years now, primarily 12 volt Garden lighting. Once the energy audit is complete, the electrician lays out a list of recommendations. Proper identification of the type of electrical wire and wire insulation is useful for those seeking to guess at the age of a building or of its electrical system, and in some instances it is helpful in assessing the condition and safety of the building wiring system, such as taking note of the presence of branch circuit solid conductor aluminum electrical wire that has not been properly repaired - a fire hazard.</p>

Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider. Updated breakers and wiring in your panel will ensure that your home's power needs are met properly and safely.</p>

These certification providers have databases of qualifying contractors in each category and field of practice, so you can choose the right electrical contractor for your needs. Here is an example of what I'm talking about or a situation that could become complicated and if you're not going to redo your electrical system, it wouldn't be a bad idea to avoid walking around these exposed wires in your attic.</p>
