<p>With the late nineteenth century seeing developments in using electricity for residential and industrial use, along with this came the electrician for installation and maintenance. From appliances to communication equipment and lighting, a home generator system that provides backup electricity can help to alleviate the stress associated with losing power at the most inappropriate time.

When getting a back up generator, one of the first questions you must ask and answer is, "What type of fuel will I use?"
