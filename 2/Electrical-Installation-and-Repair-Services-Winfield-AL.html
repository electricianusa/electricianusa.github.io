A licensed Electrical Contractor shall utilize the appropriately licensed or registered individuals to construct, install, repair or maintain electrical wiring. A landscape maintenance contract is the most cost-effective way to maintain your outdoor lighting systems. It is the most widely adopted safety code in the United States and the world, and it is the benchmark for safe electrical installations.</p>
<p>And now new vibration testing tools provide the maintenance professional with a valuable new way not just to listen, but to find mechanical problems and fixes: these new troubleshooting tools are engineered to detect and evaluate machine vibration immediately and recommend any needed repairs. Likewise, the new ground wire is spliced into the circuit at the receptacle. This will ensure that all of the fixtures in your lighting design are receiving adequate energy to function at their full desired brightness.</p>
<p>During a service update, it may be necessary to have access to many existing electrical boxes scattered throughout the basement. See how the pros use outdoor lighting to highlight landscape design and beautiful exteriors.

<p>Surge protectors will indeed protect computers and other electronic devices from power surges and most distant lightning strikes, but they can't prevent a direct lighting strike from causing damage to connected devices. Low voltage landscape lighting wire or landscape lighting cable as it is often referred as, is made of multi-strands of copper wire that are bound together. According to the EFSi, arcing faults cause more than 30,000 home fires each year in the US alone, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries - atop more than $750 million in property damage.</p>
<p>Because low voltage lighting systems operate on only 12 volts of electricity, they are completely safe for self installation. When a wire breaks, the electrical spark will arc - or jump - across the gap in order to complete the circuit. When fuses were used, homes didn't require that much electricity. Propane and petrol generators provide a safe, longer fuel supply and are significantly more environment-friendly than gasoline fueled generators. Our outdoor lighting specialists will design and install the landscape lighting that will give you all of the above benefits and make sure that your home remains up-to-code.</p>
