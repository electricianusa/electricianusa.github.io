These energy efficient lights can be installed in recessed housing in walls, ceilings, and even floors.

<p>Your neutral bar connects to the neutral wire of the main circuit and brings electricity back to your panel after delivering needed power to all the parts of your home. Also, circuit breakers last about 20-30 years, and after that time, they need to be replaced.

The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc).</p>
