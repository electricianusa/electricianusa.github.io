When a wire breaks, the electrical spark will arc - or jump - across the gap in order to complete the circuit. When fuses were used, homes didn't require that much electricity. Propane and petrol generators provide a safe, longer fuel supply and are significantly more environment-friendly than gasoline fueled generators.
