Choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house can be stressful you need to pick the right piece since it's quite pricy. Most gardens will be amply illuminated by a maximum of 500 watts for security and 40 to 100 watts for lighting up a small area such as a doorway.</p>
<p>One of the switch wires goes to the black panel wire and the other to the brass terminal on the new outlet, regardless of what color they are.
