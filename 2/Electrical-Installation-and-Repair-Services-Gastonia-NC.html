<p>Based on your description of painted wires and the age I also wonder whether you have some aluminum wiring. The 14-2 or 12-2 cable leaves breaker box and travels to the first junction box. However, these older apartments with obsolete electrical panels may not be able to support your modern electrical needs. In addition to these norms, to further aid the users, the government has also provided some basic guidelines for the proper installation, maintenance and disposal of generators that consumers should know about.</p>
<p>Today, most homes have what is officially called the electrical service panel, or simply, the service panel. Check for a second hot wire also present in the same box. Unlike standard lightbulbs, recessed lighting bulbs are concealed within the wall or ceiling, creating a pleasant lighting effect without being noticeable. LED lights are also flexible. Finally, some households overuse power cords. Installing a low-voltage lighting system is both safe and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Using surge protectors extends the life of appliances and electronics by as much as 30%. Alternative power generation, such as solar and wind, is an emerging field that should require more electricians for installation. We are happy to answer any questions you may have, and can also schedule a convenient time for you to meet a highly trained, experienced electrician in your area. An electric service upgrade is often recommended or required to increase the capacity of the existing electrical service.</p>
