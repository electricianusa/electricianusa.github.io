LED bulbs can last up to 30 years, where standard bulbs need to be replaced every year or so. Furthermore, because LED fixtures are smaller, they allow for lighting designs which previously may have been impossible due to the limitations of standard systems.</p>
<p>Our team has been extensively trained in the wiring, installation, and electrical integration of all lighting types and styles, and we are equally capable of providing both indoor and outdoor lighting installs. When the outer door is open and the circuit breakers switches are exposed, the panel is still safe to touch under normal conditions.
