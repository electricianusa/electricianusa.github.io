<p>To properly troubleshoot an electric circuit, you must know how each electrical component in the unit should function and be able to evaluate the performance of each component.

Water and electricity combined are lethal so never combine them. This post is here to help you gain at least a little bit of understand about the wiring and electrical world. When you have a panel full of light switches, it can be challenging to remember which is which.

<p>A small device to protect a computer, telephone, television set, or the like from damage by high-voltage electrical surges. So you'll connect the black hot wire coming from power to either black screw and then connect the black wire coming from the light fixture to the brass screw.
