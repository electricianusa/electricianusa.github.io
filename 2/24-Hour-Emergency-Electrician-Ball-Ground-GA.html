High voltage power may be run to a central driver location ideally, within 50 feet of wire length from lighting, depending on the system and wire types), and then all wiring downstream of the drivers may be Class 2.

A daisy chain configuration can be useful for certain types of landscape lighting, but it is important to be aware of its drawbacks.
