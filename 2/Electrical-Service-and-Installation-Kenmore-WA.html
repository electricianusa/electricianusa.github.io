<p>Your electrical contractor will have honed their skills over the years working on a broad range of jobs. For the most part, as long as it is properly installed and regularly maintained, it kicks in when needed in the events of long-lasting power outages. If you have old, outdated wiring, there is a higher possibility of electrical fire. This will expose the surrounding areas and the cables themselves to high temperatures, from which an electrical fire can start. Learn safety tips from our friend, Louie the Lightning Bug, and find videos, games and more to teach children how to stay safe around electricity.</p>

<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box. With the outlet, I used a receptacle that allows for side wiring (traditional), or back-wiring (not back-stab, but where there's a plate under the screw that clamps down on the wires).
