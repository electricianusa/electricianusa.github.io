Thus, the owner is responsible for all issues related to the electric service panel. Currently, many homeowners are doing this update because they find that they can no longer add a new appliance or a device that uses electricity because their current electric panel does not have enough capacity.</p>
<p>The purpose of electrical wiring is to efficiently and safely carry electricity from where it is generated to where it is consumed. Being licensed means that an exam has been passed and the necessary qualifications to do the work is guaranteed. Lastly, remove the ground wire from the green screw.
