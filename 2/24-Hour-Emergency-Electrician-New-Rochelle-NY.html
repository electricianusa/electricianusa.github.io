Our mission is to heighten awareness of the benefits of surge protection to all users of low voltage electrical systems in North America for the purpose of promoting proper application and usage.</p>
<p>If the 14-3 wires are the hot wires entering the box, and if only 14-2 is leaving the junction box, cap off the unused (typically the red) hot lead. Do not use light duty extension cords in a non-residential situation. Air-cooled generators are smaller and less costly, but they're also louder than liquid-cooled models, even though liquid-cooled generators are typically larger. This wiring is now required in most switch boxes as of 2011. An effective preventive electrical maintenance program involves scheduling routine inspections and checkups on a regular basis, ensuring that your equipment and machinery is continually checked for both minor and major problems.</p>

<p>After all, your light switches don't belong in your pocket. You want people driving by to take a second look because what you've created is interesting,” says Chris Mitchell of landscape lighting firm NiteLiters in Owensboro, Ky. To avoid disruption of your day and unplanned downtime, we recommend having your generator checked regularly by trained professionals like those at Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling. Avoid placing power cords close to electric devices that emit heat.</p>
<p>Keep all appliance cords away from hot surfaces (toasters, range tops, ovens, etc.). Cords can be damaged by excessive heat. These 12V led lights will not get over heated or burn up like other incandescent or halogen bulb fixtures and will remain pretty cool outside ever after long hours of running since they produce a minimum amount of heat to the surroundings as well. After that, remove the screws on the light switch itself and gently pull it out of the wall.</p>
