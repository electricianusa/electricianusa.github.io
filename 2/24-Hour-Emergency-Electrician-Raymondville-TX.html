<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
<p>The electrical contractor will determine how much power is being used and which systems require the most. You also need to pass a trade exam to acquire this license.

There were a couple of other what the heck did they do here??!‚Äù boxes, and so I asked the electrician to change them out after installing can lights in one of the rooms.</p>

Turn the power back on. As you progress in replacing bigger and more complicated fixtures you may want to try installing a new fixture where one did not exist.
