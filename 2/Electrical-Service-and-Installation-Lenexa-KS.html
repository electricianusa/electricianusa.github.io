Components connected in parallel are connected so the same voltage is applied to each component. Natural disasters can wreak havoc on complex wiring systems, and it is emergencies like these where a homeowner or a business owner will need the assistance of a licensed electrician.</p>
<p>For most projects, some combination of high and low voltage electrical systems are already being installed.
