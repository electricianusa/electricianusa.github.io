Power from your utility company flows into your home through this panel, where it branches out into major electrical branches, dwindling into smaller branches in order to distribute power. However, there are some differences between installing low voltage outdoor lighting systems and installing light fixtures in your home.

<p>Low voltage lighting is often a do-it-yourself project and there are many options to suit your budget. Our welcoming staff will schedule residential or commercial electrical estimates and meet you on-site in order to assess the amount of work and materials needed in order to get the most accurate price. From there, students focus on troubleshooting components, circuits and motors. The size of the transfer switch (based on amperage rating) and the location where it will be installed will be determined by your electrician.</p>
