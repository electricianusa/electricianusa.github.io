Since the transformer is already plugged in, the fixture should light up. If it doesn't, pull apart the connector and try again, or check the lightbulb. You should consider the architecture of your house when choosing the style of the light fixture. Sharp prongs inside the connectors pierce the cable and make contact with the wires.</p>
<p>You can also call 1-800-624-4488 and speak with one of our knowledgeable staff members for more advice on landscape lighting. Power from your utility company flows into your home through this panel, where it branches out into major electrical branches, dwindling into smaller branches in order to distribute power. However, there are some differences between installing low voltage outdoor lighting systems and installing light fixtures in your home. GFCIs (ground-fault circuit interrupters) can greatly reduce the risk of shock by immediately shutting off an electrical circuit when that circuit represents a shock hazard (i.e., a person comes in contact with a faulty appliance together with a grounded surface).</p>
<p>Low voltage lighting is often a do-it-yourself project and there are many options to suit your budget. Our welcoming staff will schedule residential or commercial electrical estimates and meet you on-site in order to assess the amount of work and materials needed in order to get the most accurate price. From there, students focus on troubleshooting components, circuits and motors. The size of the transfer switch (based on amperage rating) and the location where it will be installed will be determined by your electrician.</p>
