Some generators are certified to be kept as close as 18 inches from your house. Leave the wire loose as we will be encircling each fixture with a small loop of cable before burying it. Use 14 gauge wire for jobs totaling less than two hundred watts, and 12 gauge cable for systems that exceed 200 watts. Newer electrical codes require arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) protection for all branch circuits supplying receptacles, switches, light fixtures, smoke detectors, etc., in essentially all locations in the dwelling except bathrooms, basement storage areas and garages.</p>
<p>If you're planning to have a professional quality landscape lighting system installed, the best time to consult the designer is when you are still in the landscape planning stages, or as you are winding up your planting plans.
