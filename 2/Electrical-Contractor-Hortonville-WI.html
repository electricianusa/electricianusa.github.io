Once you're sure that power is shut off to the wire that will be fed into the old-work box, insert the old-work box into the drywall opening with the power wire running through the drywall opening and fed through the old-work box with at least six to seven inches of the wire exposed (you can use a wire stripper to strip the wire ). Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>

But the catch is that, unlike an ordinary switch, some of these new switches require a neutral to operate correctly.</p>
<p>Although most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, some start out by attending a technical school. They range from expensive architectural grade deck light fixtures with metal housings and baked on finish for long years of use to systems with plastic housings at a lower cost and shorter life span. Tip: If there are two switches mounted side by side in the junction box or two switches on one unit, be sure that the circuit governing both switches are turned off.</p>
