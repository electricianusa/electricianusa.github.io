The main component for distributing safe voltage to all landscaping lights is the transformer. With our knack for design using quality LED lighting, we take pride in the fact that our customers trust us to design and create a beautiful nighttime effect for their house, landscape, or property that will enhance curb appeal and increase security.

<p>Your transformer can be set to turn on and off based on time or even the level of sunlight, meaning it will turn on as the sun goes down at night and off as the sun comes up in the morning, a useful feature both for efficiency and security.
