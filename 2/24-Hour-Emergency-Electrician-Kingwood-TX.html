<p>Follow the rules above for extension cords and triple taps, and apply common sense to your electrical needs overall. Reliability means you can be sure that the installed electrical systems will continue to perform for a long period of time and as they were designed. Never use electrical gadgets or appliances near water. I can only speculate as to why the writers of that rule included it, but without a neutral in the switch box, there is no legal or safe method starting a new circuit there.</p>

If the power demand for a circuit approaches the amps the circuit is rated for, the circuit breaker will trip and shut down power to the circuit, because there is a danger of the wiring overheating.</p>
<p>The electrical panel in your home relies on circuit breakers or fuses to keep your electronic gadgets powered, and with the number of gadgets always increasing, so too does the importance of your panel.
