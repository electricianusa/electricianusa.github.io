<p>Should I Upgrade My Electrical Panel? The exception here is if the outlet that's controlled by the light switch is only connected to that light switch and there aren't any other wires. Here's what electrical cable looks like inside. Oftentimes, the light problem isn't from the light fixture itself, but from the light switch. Circuit breakers are contained within your electrical panel and their job is to protect the electrical circuits in your home or building by stopping the flow of electricity in the event of an overload, short-circuit, or other electrical fault.</p>

After any electrical wiring issues in your home have been repaired, take some time to learn about electricity and what to do in the case of an emergency.</p>
<p>Each electrical contractor must employ at least one master electrician. Now pull out the white wires that are inside of the switch box, but do not take them apart.
