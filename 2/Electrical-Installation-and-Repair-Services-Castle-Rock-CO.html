This is assuming that the feed to all the other outlets comes from the first, switched. Wind storms, ice accumulations and heavy snows may reduce the normal space between energized electrical lines and the ground. Portable generators must be kept outside in a dry area, never inside the home or any enclosed or partially-enclosed spaces such as your basement, garage, or crawl space because of the carbon monoxide (CO) emitted while the generator is running, electrocution and fire risks.</p>
<p>Your home's electrical panel might have a serious defect if it's more than 25 years old, because there are some electrical panels from that era that have known safety issues due to poor design. Tripped circuit breakers. Our electricians can perform an electrical system inspection to check that your home is up to code.
