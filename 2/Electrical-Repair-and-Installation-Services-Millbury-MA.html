Your electrical panel takes electricity originating from the electric company and distributes it throughout your home. It offers more protection than a standard circuit breaker, and plug-in RCDs can cost as little as Â£10 (although fixed devices provide even greater safety). We listen to homeowners, who tell us they consider landscape lighting as an investment in beauty, safety, and entertainment for their home.</p>
<p>If it is suspected that the coil is at fault, disconnect the power from the circuit ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) and, with an ohmmeter, check the resistance of the coil, which should be very low on a DC resistance check.
