<p>Some in-ground fixtures come with covers, leaf-guards or gravel screens. You can use the existing wires, but be aware that after a long time, the wires will be stiff and coated in dirt. That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code.
