Having a generator on hand lends peace of mind in case of a weather emergency or other power interruption. Feel confident that AEC emergency electrical service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist you with all your emergency electrical needs.</p>

Electricians will perform a diversity of tasks for both residential and commercial buildings. Factory electricians troubleshoot, install and undertake maintenance tasks on motors, industrial robots, electrical generators and controls on machinery.

<p>Electricians must go through at least four years of training as an apprentice, followed by the licensing their state requires. If you need assistance with your smoke or carbon monoxide systems call the licensed electricians at Stack Electric. 6,000-volt surge protection guards against power irregularities that can be a hazard to LED landscape lighting. 3 Independent Electrical Contractors (IEC) is another trade association for electrical contractors with 70 chapters across the U.S. They provide education and training via a U.S. Department of Labor recognized apprenticeship program.</p>
