This change will alter the wiring coming into your home, meaning that the replacement breakers will not match the existing fuse sizes. Where a stationary generator would be required are situations where power must be restored immediately should an outage occur.</p>

Yes, extension cords must be used as a temporary solution only and ought to be placed around the walls to avert tripping and it should not be placed under the rugs or carpet. Check for the UL seal, and make sure it's a "transient voltage surge suppressor." Making sure that the surge protector you're planning to buy is both certified by Underwriter's Laboratories, and at least meets their UL 1449 standards (required for the label "transient voltage surge suppressor,") will make sure the surge protector you take home will actually protect the equipment you plug into it.</p>
