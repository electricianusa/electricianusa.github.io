These fires involved equipment such as wiring, lighting, cords and plugs. If you're not having any problems with your electrical system, there's a good chance that you won't need to do any modifications or repairs to it.

Although aluminum is more cost-effective, electricians warn homeowners that this type of wiring must be installed properly, otherwise it can increase the risk of house fires.</p>
