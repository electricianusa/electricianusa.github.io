<p>Electrical Contractor License: There is an exam held by the Contractors Licensing Board after which you can get your license. This book is a collection of hard-earned safety standards that many have given their lives so that you and I can reap the benefits of electric power. Never touch the bus bar inside an electrical service panel unless the main breaker has been turned off or the main fuse removed. One of the dangers of PVC wiring is that if there are a lot of wires confined in a small area, this may lead the wires to overheat.</p>
<p>If your transformer low voltage side feeds ( hooks up to ) a relay, then you'd take the farthest lights away from that relay and hook them up BACK to that same relay where the circuit takes off to feed the first lights. But none of these lights can compare to the LED light bulb. Check electrical cords to make sure they are not running across doorways or under carpets where they are can get damaged. In the safe use of electricity in the home, circuit breakers should be used to terminate power to outlets.</p>
