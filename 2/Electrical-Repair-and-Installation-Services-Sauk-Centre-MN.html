<p>Take a look at what a residential electrician course would look like. PowerPro's extraordinary service begins with the selection of the perfect generator for your application. Start with an overall picture of the existing Meter and Main Panel, including either the mast for an overhead service, or the Conduit feeding from an underground service. Since these lights are not solar powered, you don't have to worry about them dimming or not lasting through the night.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages.
