A surge protector is usually installed in communications structures, process control systems, power distribution panels or other substantial industrialized systems. Click here for more safety and energy-saving tips for your water heater. 120v systems must be installed by a licensed electrical contractor and may require a permit. The final tip to prevent an electrical fire in your home would be to follow our previously mentioned statement and only trust a licensed electrician when fixing intricate wiring issues.</p>
<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house. The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes.

Lay the light fixtures in the approximate spots where they will be installed, and run the cable across the ground from light to light.</p>
