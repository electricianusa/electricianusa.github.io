When aluminum wires are only twisted together, like you would with copper, the wires expand and contract then current flows through them which produces heat from the poor connection and if the wires has oxidized, this will heat up the connection even further, causing a potential for overheating and a possible fire.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for upgrading an electric panel is because it simply does not have the capacity to deal with modern appliances. The small cost of preventive maintenance relative to major power outages further confirm our need to provide our customers with the best possible systems to allow them to strive in their area of business.
