<p>As a residential electrician you will face the potential for electric shocks, falls, fires, and injuries related to equipment and tools and simply being in a construction site. Regardless, they're more than capable in energizing your home, especially when compared to other, portable generators.

<p>They are easy to build or install, safe to operate, affordable and will supply enough electricity to operate your entire home. Our Standby Generator Sizing Calculator lets you select what in your home you want to power and directs you to the appropriate-sized generator system.

<p>However, the electrician also needs to know beforehand exactly which switch is directly linked to the specific light fixture to be replaced.

Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch.
