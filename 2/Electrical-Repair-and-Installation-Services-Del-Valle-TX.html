Faster response - When utility power fails, KOHLER generators restore power to your home three times faster than competitive models. Here's some vital information to help ensure your safety around utility poles and power lines. But the low-voltage wiring on the low voltage secondary wiring that is operated by wall switches and used to control 120V devices may itself be un fused.</p>
<p>Follow the rules above for extension cords and triple taps, and apply common sense to your electrical needs overall.

If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician. If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>
