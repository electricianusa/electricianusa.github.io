When getting a back up generator, one of the first questions you must ask and answer is, "What type of fuel will I use?" Of course, gasoline is the most commonly used fuel but the problem with gas is; you can only store so much.</p>
<p>Your value here goes to waste if you're not deliberate about it. Whether you create a patio, barbecue island, or a full outdoor kitchen, you have a great place for entertaining, spending time with family, or just getting some fresh air in the safety of your own home.

And also, for your safety, throw off the master switch for the fuse box, just to be sure you don't get shocked when putting in the new one.</p>
