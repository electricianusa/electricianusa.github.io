Bottom line: I recommend that you purchase a new high-quality surge protector (#ad) to protect your new computer from routine power surges and distant lightning strikes. I think it's safe to say that in general it's common practice to use a twist-on connector to splice pigtails or individual wires at an individual hot or neutral wire where more connections are needed than fit with the original wire.</p>
<p>Protection of the power line against direct strokes is through a ground wire or protector tube. Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider.

You can easily keep your electronics and home safe with the use of surge protectors that you can find at the web site. Turn off the power to the switch at the main circuit breaker or fuse panel.
