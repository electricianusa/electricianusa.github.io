One of the first questions I ask a potential client is why they want to upgrade their panel or service.

Not only do fuse boxes create additional safety concerns, but they could be a reason that home insurance companies refuse to cover your home (or pay out if you do get coverage). When issues arise with your generator, it is best to rely on a licensed electrician who has an in-depth knowledge of these systems. A typical low-voltage system reduces your 120-volt residential electricity to 12 or 24 volts.</p>
