For maximum light output and fixture life, the goal when installing low voltage systems is to provide each lamp with between 10.5 and 11.5 volts. Running on the home's natural gas or LP fuel supply, it is less expensive to run than gasoline and does not need to be refilled. DO have an adult put safety caps on all unused electrical outlets.</p>

Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
