If your home has two-prong outlets, there's no safe way to update them to modern three-prong outlets, short of calling a licensed electrician. You see, solar lighting runs purely off the power it draws from the sun during the day. In many cases, putting in a spa or sauna requires a dedicated electrical circuit, and this should be handled by a licensed professional. Working as anelectrician is one of the best jobs you can secure with only a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>
<p>Unscrew these screws then remove the plates covering each switch.

Unplug unused appliances and stow cords safely out of reach of pets, young children or hazardous situations. Turn the power back on at the circuit breaker.
