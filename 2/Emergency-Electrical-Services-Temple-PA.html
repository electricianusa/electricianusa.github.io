<p>The aluminum stranded wiring you see on the 220 volt appliance and air conditioning circuits do not pose a problem. Backup generators work on a just in case” basis. Single lights may not provide all the lighting you need. Connect all the fixtures and use a graph paper for calculation of the total length of wire that you need, which would be restricted to a maximum of 250W on a length of 12 gauge cable. It's important to note that different states and local governing bodies will have different sets of licensing requirements for electricians Some states will require more extended periods of working under a journeyman electrician which can influence when and how an apprentice can become authorized to wire either commercial or residential buildings.</p>
