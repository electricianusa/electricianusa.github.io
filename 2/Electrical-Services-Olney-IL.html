For licensing purposes, electrical wiring work is defined in schedule 1 of the Home Building Act 1989 as having the same meaning as it has in the Gas and Electricity (Consumer Safety) Act 2017.

<p>I believe that's how it was, and yes the switch works in its updated function of controlling the ceiling lights. More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps.

Instead, electricity flows from the transformer terminal into your house and electronics and back again by way of continuous wire paths between them.</p>
