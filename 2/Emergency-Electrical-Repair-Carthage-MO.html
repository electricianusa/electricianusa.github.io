All electricity that passes through your home must first travel through the breakers to ensure the safe passage of electricity through the system. Destination Lighting also has a growing selection of low voltage landscape lights that are easier to install and safe to operate in wet conditions. Deck and step lights are designed to help make navigating decks, patios and outdoor stairways much safer at night.</p>
<p>Installation is simple; just use the real metal stake to install each light into the ground in the perfect location. And if more than 15 amps flows through the circuit, the breaker trips. The transfer switch automatically starts the generator, which powers the circuits in the subpanel.
