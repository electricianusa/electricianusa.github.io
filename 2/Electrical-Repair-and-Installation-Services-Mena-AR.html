Egress lighting typically lasts 10 years , as long as the lights used are LED and not incandescent lamps. To make it a half hot you will have to run new wire from the switch to the outlet. Scorch marks and burning smells: Signs of electrical burning are a sure-fire sign that something is wrong with your panel.</p>
