<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house.

<p>Electrical outlets that power appliances with 120 volts of electricity have two screws or terminals on each side, one set being brass-colored and the other set a shiny nickel-colored. People often buy surge protectors for other kinds of wiring connections such as those for telephone and cable tv wiring. When it's time to sell a house, having updated electrical wiring and making all repairs, if necessary, is imperative to show a potential buyer that the house is safe.</p>
<p>The electricians listed below install whole-house surge protection devices. This is why it's very important to understand what a surge protector is and some of the benefits that it can offer you whenever the surge protector is installed directly onto your electric panel. Alternatively, you can splice two pigtails to the "hot wire" at the outlet and terminate one on each of the brass terminals so that each half of the outlet is using the same source of power.</p>
