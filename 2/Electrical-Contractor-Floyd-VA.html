After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses. Your electrical services provider will know all the safety precautions they need to take and can even identify potential problems before they take hold.</p>
<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them. Also, do not touch electrical appliances with wet hands. Spot lights can be angled and used with shrouds to direct the light exactly where desired.</p>

<h3>The Basics of Electrical Installation and Wiring in Floyd VA</h3>
<p>Low voltage landscape lighting is safer for use outdoors because it reduces the risks of electrocution when installing a system or repairing one. We'll take care of all the details and provide complete lighting solutions that you can enjoy without any hassle. From path lights to step lights to led rope lights and recessed trim lighting, the variety is endless. The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>Unlike high voltage, Class 1 wiring, Class 2 wiring need not be installed by a licensed electrician. Residential electricians install wiring and troubleshoot electrical problems in peoples' homes, which can be either single-family or multi-family dwellings. Although lighting brings your garden and exterior amenities to life at night time, facade or feature lighting to the exterior of your home should also be considered. All your electrical appliances and components share a common factor: the breaker panel.</p>
<p>Low voltage lighting is often a do-it-yourself project and there are many options to suit your budget. Our welcoming staff will schedule residential or commercial electrical estimates and meet you on-site in order to assess the amount of work and materials needed in order to get the most accurate price. From there, students focus on troubleshooting components, circuits and motors. The size of the transfer switch (based on amperage rating) and the location where it will be installed will be determined by your electrician.</p>
