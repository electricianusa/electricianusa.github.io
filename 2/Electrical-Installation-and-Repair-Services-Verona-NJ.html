<p>Moe, twist on connectors are used to connect the incoming and outgoing hot, neutral, and ground wires, and a single pigtail length in that same twist-on connector can connect the ground to the local junction box. During an outage, it automatically supplies power to essential circuits within seconds, restoring electricity and peace of mind. Apply to be a master electrician on job-seeking websites.
