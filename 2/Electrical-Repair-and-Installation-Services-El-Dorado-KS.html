Electrical work is defined in the Electricity (Licensing) Regulations 1991 and means work on electrical machines or instruments, on an electrical installation or on electrical appliances or equipment to which electricity is supplied or intended to be supplied, at a nominal pressure exceeding 50 volts alternating current or 120 volts direct current, whether or not the thing on which the work is being performed is part of, or is connected to or to be connected to, any distribution works or private generating plant and, where work is performed on any appliance, whether or not electricity is supplied or may be supplied thereto through an electric plug socket or socket outlet.</p>

Basically, the skeleton of the installation will be reviewed to see if the correct gauge wire is installed and harnessed correctly, as well as other measures.</p>
<p>Keeping the lights closer to the transformer will help eliminate the voltage drop that occurs when lights are further away.
