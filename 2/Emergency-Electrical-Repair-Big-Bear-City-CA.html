<p>If your box needs maintenance, we'll be glad to administer it. Count on us to keep your breaker box in its best condition, so your electrical service stays functional. Some home insurance policies do not cover losses that result from electrical work that was not completed by a licensed electrician. This sudden demand for huge power output upsets the flow of electrical current along with your power system.

<p>Electricians need to be strong enough to move heavy components, which may weigh up to 50 pounds. Be wary of items purchased outside or imported into the UK, as these don't always meet national safety standards, and definitely avoid counterfeit electrical goods (such as off-brand hair straighteners), which are the leading cause of electrical shocks and fires.

Fitted to the Generac 7033 standby generator is a 200-amp NEMA 3 whole-house smart transfer switch that is rated for both in- and outdoor usage. The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc).</p>
