<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician in Granite Bay</h2>
<p>Importance of hiring a certified and licensed electrician. Some of the changes to restrictions that were set out in the new Part P aspect of the building regulations were seen as being controversial as under the new regulations, the undertaking of any work other than simple changes such as changing a light switch became notifiable to the local building control authority; so work such as any work in a kitchen or bathroom or work in other areas that are being re-wired will require a professional body, i.e. a trained electrician, to carry them out.</p>
<p>From my first call to Progressive's office, my conversation with the electrical manager, through the end of the job when all was done, Progressive did a great job for me.
