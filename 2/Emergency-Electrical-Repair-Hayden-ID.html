<p>The earliest standardized method of wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s, was knob and tube (K&T) wiring: single conductors were run through cavities between the structural members in walls and ceilings, with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs attached to the structural members to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires.

Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers.
