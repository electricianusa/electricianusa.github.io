<p>Electrical wiring in a residential home is serious business, especially when it comes to the safety of your family. Rowe is an electrical contractor by trade, and operated his own small business for 35 years. Landscape lights that make soft spots of light are good for garden paths. You can substitute one year of electrical curriculum for half a year of experience up to a maximum of 2,000 hours. That's why we provide a Safety & Savings Plan for our residential electrical customers.</p>
<p>When considering an upgrade to your home's electrical wiring, you must take into account the age of your home and the age of the current wiring that is installed. Lights in your home do little good if you can't turn them on, and the power going through your home is useless if your outlets aren't ready and capable to handle appliances. Flickering fluorescent lights, broken light switches, and old wiring are no match for lighting repair professionals. We do want to make it clear, though, that are probably a lot of great small electrical engineering firms out there; we just focused on the larger firms based on specific requests and available information.</p>
