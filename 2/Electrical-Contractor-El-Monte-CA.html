Low voltage landscape lighting systems uses a transformer which lowers the electrical output to the lights. Each receptacle has a 120-volt ‘hot' wire, a neutral wire and a ground. This is especially true if you're using a permanent standby power generator. This generator is fitted with a Vanguard V-Twin OHV engine that allows for easy conversion between liquid propane and natural gas during installation.</p>
