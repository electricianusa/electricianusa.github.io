They range from expensive architectural grade deck light fixtures with metal housings and baked on finish for long years of use to systems with plastic housings at a lower cost and shorter life span. Tip: If there are two switches mounted side by side in the junction box or two switches on one unit, be sure that the circuit governing both switches are turned off.</p>
