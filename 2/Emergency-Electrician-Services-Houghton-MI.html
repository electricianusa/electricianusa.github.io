High voltage power may be run to a central driver location ideally, within 50 feet of wire length from lighting, depending on the system and wire types), and then all wiring downstream of the drivers may be Class 2.

<h3>Repair Underground Electrical Wiring in Houghton MI</h3>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>Take a home theater surge protector as an example. A great deal of electrical maintenance work depends on the ability of maintenance electricians to read and understand electrical diagrams. A transformer is a small device that converts the high voltage power (120 V or 230 V, depending on your location) from your electric main to a lower voltage (usually 12 volts). Step and pathway lights are popular for lining walkways, and in-ground well lights add a remarkable upward glow to water or architectural features.</p>
