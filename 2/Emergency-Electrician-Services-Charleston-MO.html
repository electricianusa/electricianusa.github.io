Our skilled electricians will hang your ceiling fan on your existing preinstalled fan box, or install new wiring, switches and a fan-rated brace box for any area of your home. If that's the case, you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and a ground wire connected to the outlet. It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>

LED and other low voltage lights come in a huge variety of styles and are perfect for creating soft and elegant mood lighting.</p>
