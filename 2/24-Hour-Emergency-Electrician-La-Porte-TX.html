There will also be one large switch, usually at the top of the panel; this is the main circuit breaker, and it controls power flow to the entire electric panel. When homeowners start experiencing flickering lights and can feel heat coming the panel, it is time to call an electrician for an upgrade. Homeowners can invest in a home standby air-cooled generator size that used to only be available in much more expensive, liquid-cooled models, giving them the lowest cost per kilowatt available.</p>
<p>For instance, instead of 14 AWG ( American wire gauge ) copper wire, aluminium wiring would need to be 12 AWG on a typical 15 ampere lighting circuit, though local building codes vary. It's also worth considering the placement of light switches if family members are getting older or have lost mobility and would have trouble reaching a switch while seated in a wheelchair. A digital timer may be used for more complex lighting systems where multiple start times are required including start times on different days of the week.</p>
