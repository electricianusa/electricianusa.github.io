In many ways, a relatively active job like electrical work is preferable to a job that has you parked in front of a computer all day - the dangers of sitting down for long periods of time are well-documented , and this isn't something you'll have to worry about too often when you're working as an electrician, zipping from one job to the next all day long.</p>
<p>Consequently, electricians with less than a year of experience make up just 2 percent of the workforce. Since the systems use low voltage of only 12 volts, the systems are safe for the novice to install, and the components are lightweight, making them easy to handle.
