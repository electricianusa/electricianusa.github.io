You may get shocked by electricity if you attempt to upgrade the electrical panel yourself.</p>
<p>The same thing occurs in industry, a fuse in a circuit blows and the maintenance person gets the replacement fuse and inserts it into the fuseholder. It does add additional cost to the installation of the generator, but the peace of mind provided may be what your situation needs.
