<p>Modern technology, on one hand, has greatly increased the energy load on old electrical systems, while at the same time providing new features to enhance safety, improve efficiency and cut energy costs. If you are looking for a generator that offers quieter operation, the Generac Core Power 5837 is the quietest while the Briggs & Stratton 40445 has the smallest footprint and Generac 7043 tops the list when it comes to advanced features.

<p>If the 14-3 wires are the hot wires entering the box, and if only 14-2 is leaving the junction box, cap off the unused (typically the red) hot lead. Do not use light duty extension cords in a non-residential situation. Air-cooled generators are smaller and less costly, but they're also louder than liquid-cooled models, even though liquid-cooled generators are typically larger. This wiring is now required in most switch boxes as of 2011. An effective preventive electrical maintenance program involves scheduling routine inspections and checkups on a regular basis, ensuring that your equipment and machinery is continually checked for both minor and major problems.</p>
