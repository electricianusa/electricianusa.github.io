To give you an idea about such common electrical wiring questions, you would need to work on a hot electrical panel. I thought water or perhaps mouse urine from the attic, but then the top outside of the box would be corroded too, as would the top pair of hot and neutral wires.</p>
<p>Know the details of your project, as some electricians may specialize in certain types of electrical work. Often unseen, arc-faults can occur anywhere in the home's electrical system including within walls, at loose electrical connections or within electrical cords accidentally damaged by impinging furniture.

And like water, electricity can placed under "pressure" in this case called "voltage".
