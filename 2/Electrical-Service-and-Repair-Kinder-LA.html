<p>Power or communications cables (e.g., computer networking) that are routed in or through air-handling spaces (plenums) of office buildings are required under the model building code to be either encased in metal conduit, or rated for low flame and smoke production. The half hot outlet will have both a permanent hot and a neutral in it. Additional outlets can be powered from either that or the switch box by using the permanent hot and the neutral from either the switch box or the outlet box.</p>
