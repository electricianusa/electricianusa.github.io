Most likely you don't live in an area of the world where the sun rises and sets at the same time each day, so I recommend buying a transformer that has a photocell light sensor, the light sensor turns your outdoor lighting on at dusk and then it should have some sort of control so you can adjust how long the lights will stay on for.</p>
<p>It also contains circuit breakers that detect dangerous power surges and cut the circuit's power to reduce the risks of damage and fires. They can run on a variety of fuel options, including propane and diesel, or even be hooked up to the municipal gas lines—that way, they run cleaner and don't emit the carbon monoxide fumes of portable generators. Although the process may be quick and the price of fuses relatively low, this home repair can be time consuming and irritating.</p>

<p>Electricians should also offer fuseboard upgrades to further enhance the safety of your electrics. The thing about generators is that they still need fuel of some sort to generate electricity, and most of these ones that you will be wanting to get only last a few hours, to a day at most, and really don't put out a lot of power. Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
