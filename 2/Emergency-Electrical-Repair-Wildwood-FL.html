<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
