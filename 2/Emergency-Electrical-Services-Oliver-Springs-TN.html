<p>Keep cords away from sources of heat and water. You can't just plug in the TV — there's the TV and the receiver and the Roku and whatever else.” The group resorted to plugging power strips and extension cords into virtually every outlet.

<p>When working on electrical sockets or switches always disconnect the electricity in that circuit and make sure it cannot be re-connected accidentally.

Just keep in mind that class B license can be obtained only by farmstead and residential wiring electricians. Fuse panels used in homes normally do no allow for enough circuits that todays modern home reqire. Therefore, when a controller breaks down, it is essential for electrical maintenance personnel to know how to locate the cause of the controller malfunction and be able to make the necessary corrections.</p>
