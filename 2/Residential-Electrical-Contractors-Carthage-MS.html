It allows for reasonably sized conductors (in other word the wires) to conduct electricity without significant voltage drop.

LED and other low voltage lights come in a huge variety of styles and are perfect for creating soft and elegant mood lighting.</p>
<p>When you trip” the breaker this refers to the action of your circuit breaker doing the job it was intended to do. If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them.
