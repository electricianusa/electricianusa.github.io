<p>Some in-ground fixtures come with covers, leaf-guards or gravel screens. You can use the existing wires, but be aware that after a long time, the wires will be stiff and coated in dirt. That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code. Some homeowners want the generator installed in a garage since there is already a concrete floor and the unit will be out of the weather and safe from thieves.</p>
<p>Anytime you work with electricity, it can be very dangerous and only a qualified electrician should install this equipment. In Montgomery County, Maryland, electrical contractors need a master electrician's license before they can obtain a permit to do any work in the county. Now, that's not to suggest that there is ever a good time for electrical emergencies, but rather to call attention to the fact that there are two types of electricians in the area: those that are only available for eight hours a day and those who make sure they are on-call to assist homes in the area whenever they need it.</p>
<p>By buying a larger capacity transformer for your low voltage wiring, you ensure that you can add more lights later if you want.

By the end of the guide, you'll know exactly how to find and hire the right electrician for your job.</p>
