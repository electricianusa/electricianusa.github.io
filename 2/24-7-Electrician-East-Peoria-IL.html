I believe the man leading the installation was Keith, and he did a terrific job to make sure the generator and the associated lines for the gas and electric outside the house were clean, neat, and actually looked good. You can buy adapters that piggyback on your existing electrical wiring to transfer data - and they're easy for homeowners to install without the assistance of an electrician.
