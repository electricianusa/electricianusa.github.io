<p>Specialty Electrical Contractor: You need to be employed as a specialty contractor in the same category you're applying for and pass an exam. The professionals at Turn It On Electric know to shut off the power before doing any type of electrical work. The increased cost of fuel oil and all precious metals has caused many manufacturers of electrical equipment to inventory less than ever before, and in some cases, major electrical items needed for emergency electrical services and repair such as power transformers and high voltage switchgear are made-to-order with lead times between 20 and 50 weeks.</p>
<p>As a result, they're saving time and money on electrical projects and operating far more efficiently â€” both in the office and in the field. The transformer will plug into a standard outlet and run wiring through a loop to each light fixture. After completing this course, participants should be able to explain the basic principles of transformer operation, identify some of the basic components of a transformer, and describe checks that are generally made during a transformer inspection.</p>
