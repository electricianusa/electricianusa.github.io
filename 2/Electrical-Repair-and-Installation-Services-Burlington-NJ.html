This course introduces the fundamental principles of electrical theory as applied to electrical circuits and devices such as transformers, inductors, and capacitors.</p>
<p>Connect the wires to the light fixtures. Electrical Contractor License: Class A or Class B license or Class C certificate is required depending on the type of projects you work on.
