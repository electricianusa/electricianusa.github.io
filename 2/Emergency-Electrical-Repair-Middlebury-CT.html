<p>Breakers Are Tripping - When you have a breaker that's tripping, there's too much power that's flowing through your circuit. In this course, you will learn about the fundamentals of series and parallel circuits as well as how to calculate current, voltage, and resistance in them. The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>

It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
