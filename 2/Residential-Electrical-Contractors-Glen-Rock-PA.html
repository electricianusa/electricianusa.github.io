<p>Electrical wiring problems can potentially cause serious fire and electrocution hazards, so it's better not to take a chance if there is any question in your mind about safety.

If the location where you want your low voltage lights is some distance from the outlet, then you will need to purchase additional wiring and bury it. All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>
