This can prevent data and power loss during the transfer of power to the generator. You must have had a minimum of 8,000 hours of experience.</p>
<p>However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late.

Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>
