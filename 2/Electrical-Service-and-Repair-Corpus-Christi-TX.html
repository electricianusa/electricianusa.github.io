I'm very impressed with the quality and innovation in the new AMP line of lighting fixtures. To do everything right, here are the basic steps on installing these lights at home. Whether it's software for customer relationship management, bookkeeping, making financial projections, tracking time, managing work orders, or job bidding, it's all out there and getting better all the time.
