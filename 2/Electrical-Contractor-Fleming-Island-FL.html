<p>Permanently installed generators run on either natural gas or propane. The size of the generator you need is directly related to the appliances you want to keep power running to. If you just needed a fridge to have power, the size of the generator would be much smaller. Connected to your LP or natural gas fuel supply, the backup generator kicks in within seconds of determining a power loss and can run as long as it takes for your utility power to turn back on.</p>
<p>Today's breaker panels are far more superior in terms of size, when compared to the standard fuse box of yesterday. Continuing with its efforts to position itself as one-stop solution provider of lifestyle electrical solutions, Orient Electric forayed into the Switchgear market.
