<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Service in New Brunswick</h2>

Our mission is to heighten awareness of the benefits of surge protection to all users of low voltage electrical systems in North America for the purpose of promoting proper application and usage.</p>
<p>Using this method of twisting the wires together is the best practice for outdoor lighting, or any wire connection for that matter, it's even better then soldering the wires together because the flux in the solder will corrode the wires over time causing a poor connection or high resistance in the wires. Fitted to the Generac 7033 standby generator is a 200-amp NEMA 3 whole-house smart transfer switch that is rated for both in- and outdoor usage. The free end of one wire will connect to the green ground screw of the outlet, and the other free end is to be connected to the metal box with a green screw (expressly for that purpose) or other approved means (special clips, etc).</p>
