<p>Attach each electrical wire to the appropriate terminals on each side and tighten the screws securely. From bright light for working to soothing low levels of lighting to relax, installation of dimmers and recessed lighting can make a great difference in how your room looks and feels. Low voltage lighting requires a transformer to reduce the voltage to below 50 volts, most commonly 12 volts or 24 volts. Your home has different types of electrical circuits installed that serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Whether you are enjoying fun in the sun or playing the latest game on your phone or tablet, Vera Water and Power advises everyone to be alert of their surroundings and to stay safely away from electrical equipment.

A GFCI outlet is an extremely sensitive outlet that monitors the current passing through it. If there's a slight change in current coming back from the equipment plugged into the outlet, the GFCI will automatically disconnect the circuit so the electrical current is no longer flowing. The landscape lighting that requires the greatest effort to install is 120-volt lighting.</p>
