<p>With a specific end goal to shield your family from electricity related dangers, it is essential that you hire the services of an accomplished electrical contractors service in Adelaide to guarantee that all your home wiring is securely installed. So, now that you know what type of switch you have, you can go to the store to get that you have a three-way switch, two the terminals are the same color, you will also have two wires coming from that old switch that you need to put on the same side and you will have a third wire that is a different color that will go on the darker colored terminal and again you have your ground terminal and that is where the green wire or bare wire goes.A couple of reasons you may need to replace your outlet.</p>
