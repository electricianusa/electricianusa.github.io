<p>A resistor-based surge protector for telecommunications cables. Remember, extension cords are temporary and should not be used as a replacement for permanent wiring,‚Äù says Dwayne. Landscape Lighting Low Voltage fixtures have become the norm in landscape lighting. One indication of a service that is undersized for the demands applied to it is the blowing or popping of the main fuses or breaker switch. Faulty equipment may indicate unsafe wiring. According to the National Fire Protection Association, an average of 53,000 electrical home structure fires occur each year, claiming more than 450 lives, injuring more than 1,400 people, and causing more than $1.4 billion in property damage (National Fire Protection Association, 2002-2006).</p>

When the electricity arcs (jumps, or "arcs") from an exposed energized conductor or circuit part (e.g., overhead power lines) through a gas (such as air) to a person who is grounded (that would provide an alternative route to the ground for the electrical current). Damaged service cables running from the structural mount on your building to the breaker panel should be handled by an electrician.</p>
