<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Service in Jonesville</h2>
<p>Electrical maintenance contracts are often the source of irritation for many businesses. By using a larger fuse we may stop the problem of the fuse blowing all the time but the wire is rated to carry only 15 amps.

Remove the old lighting fixture, and make a physical note on paper detailing what wire goes where.
