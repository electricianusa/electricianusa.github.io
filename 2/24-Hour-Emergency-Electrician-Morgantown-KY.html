<p>In a typical home, these events occur on a regular basis; they can damage unprotected devices instantly or over time.

<p>Attach each electrical wire to the appropriate terminals on each side and tighten the screws securely. From bright light for working to soothing low levels of lighting to relax, installation of dimmers and recessed lighting can make a great difference in how your room looks and feels.
