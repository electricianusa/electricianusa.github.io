<p>You do not have to worry once there is a power outage because an immediate backup will work to supply you with the power supply that you require at home. The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family.

You may not be able to tell which wires feed the outlet and which go on to another outlet, but it really doesn't matter so long as the black and white wires are connected as described above.
