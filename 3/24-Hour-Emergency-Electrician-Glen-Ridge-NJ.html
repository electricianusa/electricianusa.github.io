A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit." It is important to recognize the difference between the two, noting particularly that the relay, serving a secondary role, causes other devices to function, whereas the contactor is the primary unit, doing its work in the main power circuit.</p>

<p>Sounds like an overcrowded electrical box is bending and damaging connections when you push the receptacle back into the box - an unsafe condition risking fire or shock. From time to time, you may need to add more electrical appliances to your home. What you should know about buying an emergency standby generator. Problems that appear minor on the surface sometimes cause major safety issues down the road.

<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box. With the outlet, I used a receptacle that allows for side wiring (traditional), or back-wiring (not back-stab, but where there's a plate under the screw that clamps down on the wires). Do check that there aren't some bare wires nutted together, with no insulation on them at all, though - those would be ground.</p>
