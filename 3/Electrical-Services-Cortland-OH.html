A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V).

Before doing any work on the switch, the power source must be turned off by set­ting a circuit breaker to OFF or removing a fuse.

<p>Spikes can degrade wiring insulation and destroy electronic devices like battery chargers, modems and TVs.

<p>However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late.
