<p>Children must learn that appliances such as hair dryers and electric shavers are not toys and must never be played with in the bathroom. The system was installed a few days later and the technicians (Mark and Kara) did a very thorough and professional installation. Next, unroll the spool of low-voltage electrical cable and lay the cable beside the fixtures. With preventive maintenance, you'll not only save money on future repairs but also protect your family from the dangers of an electrical issue.</p>
<p>That new door you just installed, sharp corners lost in the daylight, and intricate architectural details can all be highlighted with strategically placed bullet and wash lights.

<p>Wire and troubleshoot basic electrical control circuits to develop a logical, systematic approach to troubleshooting.

<p>You can go all out and buy the best you can afford, but you'll save some money by buying a surge protector appropriate for the equipment you'll use it with. The best places where you can install low voltage lighting are on your porches, gardens, walkways and decks. I would highly recommend TLC and Shannon for their amazing customer service, professionalism and quality work. The cost is dependent on many factors: number of fixtures (in trees, path lights, spots, can lights, specialty lights, etc.), number of transformers, vegetation and maturity of plants, timing controls & automation, whether pruning is necessary, how many specialty fixtures are onsite, etc.</p>
