<p>However, there may be local electrician licensing requirements so make sure to check these before you begin work. Licenses are issued by the State Electrical Board of North Dakota.

If it signals there is still electrical current present after you've turned the breaker off, you may have to turn power to the entire house off and proceed with a battery powered light or call an electrician.</p>

The electrical panel is usually set up just after the start of construction on a home.
