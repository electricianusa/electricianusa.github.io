<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician in Kasson</h2>
<p>PART 1 OF 2: In this video, Master electrician Scott Caron shows the first phase of replacing an antiquated electrical system. If your home has two-prong outlets, there's no safe way to update them to modern three-prong outlets, short of calling a licensed electrician.

Check and replace any electrical components that have worn, cracked or frayed cords and only use appliances in good condition. No cover plate on the electrical box. A licensed master electrician, fire alarm specialist, or sign specialty technician in combination with a contractor license may also work as a self-employed electrical, fire alarm, or sign contractor providing even further opportunities.</p>
