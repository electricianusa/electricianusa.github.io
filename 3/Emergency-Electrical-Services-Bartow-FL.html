White wires are normally used to connect to other white wires or to chrome terminal screws on switches and receptacles. They're great for lighting up pathways, trees, driveways, or landscaping around the yard. Apprentice License: The DBS-Electrical Bureau registration is required. Our team is here to make sure your home's electrical panel can always handle your needs. Surge-suppressing devices offered by other manufacturers continue to allow excess power through to the protected equipment after their own components suffer damage.</p>

<h3>Solar Panel Installation in Bartow FL and Its Advantages</h3>
<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
<p>The white wire on the switch loop is used to carry current from the source to the switch and it is marked with black tape or paint to label it as hot.
