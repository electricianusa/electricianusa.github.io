According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common injuries caused by contact with electrical energy are electric shock, burns, and falls. Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower " ampacity ". Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself.</p>
<p>Electricians may need to take classes to learn about changes to the National Electrical Code, and they often complete regular safety programs, manufacturer-specific training, and management training courses. A joule rating of at least 600 should be able to handle most household surges. Important note: NEVER increase the size of a panel breaker on a circuit that keeps tripping.
