One of the first questions I ask a potential client is why they want to upgrade their panel or service. Electricity has made our lives more enjoyable in so many ways- but that doesn't mean it comes without its risks-we'll walk you through some electrical safety tips that all homeowners should be aware of.

Physical size of the old electrical panel may be too small to preclude its re-use with a panel retrofit kit, so the entire box needs to be replaced.</p>

They can run on a variety of fuel options, including propane and diesel, or even be hooked up to the municipal gas lines—that way, they run cleaner and don't emit the carbon monoxide fumes of portable generators. Although the process may be quick and the price of fuses relatively low, this home repair can be time consuming and irritating.</p>
<p>Once you've approved our design for your outdoor lighting, our Los Feliz electrical contractors will return to your home for the installation.
