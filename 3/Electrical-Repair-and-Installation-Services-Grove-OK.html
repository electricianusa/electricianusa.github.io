Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
<p>It is also better to hire the services of an expert electrician to repair such electrical issues. You would need to combine the four 20A branch circuits in an AC combiner panel, as Marvin mentioned, and then tap onto the feeders from the meter using Polaris taps or insulation piercings.
