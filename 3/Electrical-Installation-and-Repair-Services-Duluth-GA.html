For this reason, it is prudent to invest in a Surge Protective Device or SPD to eliminate these potential threats and thus maximize the systems life expectancy. Most of us take electricity for granted, fully expecting that the outlets, wiring, extension cords, and power strips in our homes will operate safely and reliably. Power strips let us attach several devices to the same socket, drawing more current through that socket than it is ordinarily expected to conduct.</p>
