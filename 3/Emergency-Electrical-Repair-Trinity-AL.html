<p>Some in-ground fixtures come with covers, leaf-guards or gravel screens. You can use the existing wires, but be aware that after a long time, the wires will be stiff and coated in dirt. That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code. Some homeowners want the generator installed in a garage since there is already a concrete floor and the unit will be out of the weather and safe from thieves.</p>
<p>Next, you should do some research on electrical terminology so that you will understand what each diesel or petrol generator is capable of doing as well as how it operates. Cords and plugs that show signs of wear or damage need to be replaced. You need to understand that if you decide to install electrical wire you're indeed playing with fire. Consult an electrician, if necessary, to determine the exact size of circuit wiring to be sure that all circuits are properly protected against overloads.</p>
