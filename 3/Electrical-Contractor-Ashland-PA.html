A home standby generator is a little bit more of a complex undertaking than just running a portable and using an extension cord and some surge protectors.</p>
<p>Licenses that are inactive for a significant time can be revoked entirely by the state, and contractors that perform work under an inactive or revoked license may be subject to penalties. A job may be to install all new wiring and components or to work on existing or older systems. Electrical Contractor License: Master electricians and companies that employ A or B master electrician, can apply for this license.

<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
