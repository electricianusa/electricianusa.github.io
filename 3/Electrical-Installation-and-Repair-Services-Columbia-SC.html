By using a larger fuse we may stop the problem of the fuse blowing all the time but the wire is rated to carry only 15 amps. To install a timer simply remove the plug from the outlet, insert the timer into the outlet, then re-plug the transformer into the outlet on the side of the timer. Remove the old lighting fixture, and make a physical note on paper detailing what wire goes where. You can bet on Westline Electrical Services emergency electricians to provide you with quality and prompt emergency services anytime of the day or night.</p>
