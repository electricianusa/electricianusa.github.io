Proper identification of the type of electrical wire and wire insulation is useful for those seeking to guess at the age of a building or of its electrical system, and in some instances it is helpful in assessing the condition and safety of the building wiring system, such as taking note of the presence of branch circuit solid conductor aluminum electrical wire that has not been properly repaired - a fire hazard.</p>
<p>Common duties listed on Residential Electrician resume samples include installing wiring in new homes, consulting with clients, diagnosing defects, developing electrical system plans, reading blueprints, and making sure safety regulations are being followed.
