<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>Apprentices work under the direct supervision of licensed journey worker electricians.

Since your breaker panel is essentially the nervous system of your home, it's important to keep up with the maintenance and ensure that everything is working properly. But understanding the basics of your home electrical wiring doesn't have to be so intensive. Nothing you do with the white wires will do anything to provide power to the upper half of that outlet - it requires a black wire.</p>
