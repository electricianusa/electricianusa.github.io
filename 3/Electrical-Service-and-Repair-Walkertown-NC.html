<p>GFI outlets must be wired properly. GFCI outlets: Ground-fault circuit interrupters protect against electric shock and should be installed anywhere an outlet is likely to come in contact with water. Topics covered in classes can vary and might include: electronics concepts such as voltage and amperage; the science and design of pumps and mechanical motors; pneumatics and compressors; the heating and cooling cycles; and the properties of different metals, chemicals, and elastomers.</p>

<p>Circuit breakers are designed to trip or cut-off power to the circuit when more amps are being drawn than the wire is rated to carry.

Cutting through cables, drilling into wiring in the walls and trying to effect a repair while the appliance is still plugged in are just some of the causes of fatal electric shocks that occur each year in homes.</p>
