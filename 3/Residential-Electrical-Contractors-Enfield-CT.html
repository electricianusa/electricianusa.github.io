<h3>24 Hour Emergency Electrician Contractor in Enfield CT - Do You Really Need One?</h3>
<p>Size your wire accordingly, so you'll need to know what lights you'll be using from the initial rough in. Extension cords should be carefully fixed in place where possible to reduce the chance of tripping or accident. I would like to orient the outlets so that the ground opening is on top; I think it's easier to plug in grounded appliances that way. This is an essentials only” model, which can keep a few appliances and lights running but it's not going to keep your whole house lit up in the event that you lose the grid.</p>

<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box. With the outlet, I used a receptacle that allows for side wiring (traditional), or back-wiring (not back-stab, but where there's a plate under the screw that clamps down on the wires). Do check that there aren't some bare wires nutted together, with no insulation on them at all, though - those would be ground.</p>
