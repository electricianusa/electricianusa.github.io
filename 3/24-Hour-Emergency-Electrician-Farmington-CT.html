<h3>Electrical Panel Upgrades & Heavy Ups Farmington CT 06032</h3>
<p>Some people assume that the panel needs to be upgraded to provide more power. First and foremost, let's talk about the size of the conductors, or wires, in the cables. A heavy-up service is when the circuit panel is upgraded to increase the electrical capacity needed. If you have military experience and training in the electrical field and want to become licensed in Maine as a Master, Journeyman or Limited Electrician, please contact Bob LeClair via email at robert.v.leclair@ by telephone at 207-624-8678 or email the office before submitting an application.</p>

<p>Fuse Box Replacement vs Upgrade - If you have a fuse box, whether or not it is acting up, we strongly recommend an upgrade. The braided fabric wire insulation was found on a 1960's fluorescent light ballast, while the plastic wire was used in the branch circuit wiring for the light where that ballast was employed. These include old wiring, worn outlets, outdated fixtures and damaged circuits. Most times, it is not the goal of electricians to have your homes electrical wiring done wrongly.</p>

And like water, electricity can placed under "pressure" in this case called "voltage". Our technicians can install a variety of portable generators, and we'll help you select the right one for you home, so give us a call today.</p>
