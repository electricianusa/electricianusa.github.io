<h3>Electrical Panel Upgrades & Heavy Ups Farmington CT 06032</h3>
<p>Some people assume that the panel needs to be upgraded to provide more power. First and foremost, let's talk about the size of the conductors, or wires, in the cables.

The braided fabric wire insulation was found on a 1960's fluorescent light ballast, while the plastic wire was used in the branch circuit wiring for the light where that ballast was employed. These include old wiring, worn outlets, outdated fixtures and damaged circuits. Most times, it is not the goal of electricians to have your homes electrical wiring done wrongly.</p>
