If the incoming ground wire from the feed circuit was left long enough, it can be run continuously, connected to a grounding screw that connects the wire to the metal junction box (skip this step if plastic junction boxes are in use), on to the ground screw terminal at each electrical receptacle, and ending with a ground clamp crimp connector that ties the incoming ground to the ground wire of the outgoing wire that continues to the next junction box.</p>

We will review your unique situation and offer you an honest estimate on an electrical service upgrade that we guarantee will be completed on schedule. Outlets that have moisture in them may create a shock hazard. If your devices are hit with a power surge, the excess power could easily burn them out, rendering them useless. The result is damaging surges traveling to important electronics elsewhere in the house.</p>
