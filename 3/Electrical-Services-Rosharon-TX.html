This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring.

Low-voltage electrical system switches originally made by GE® or Remcon can be replaced with newer ones from Touch Plate but with some provisos which we explain below.

We offer various options, including different fuel sources like propane or natural gas, different cooling methods such as liquid-cooling or air-cooling, and a whole range of different sizes and power outputs. That means there are at least eight wires in the box: 4 hot (colored) wires, two whites, and two grounds.</p>
