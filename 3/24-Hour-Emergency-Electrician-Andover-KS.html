FireGuard is an advanced device that protects your electrical circuits from arcing faults and power surges that lead to the dangers of fire. However, sometimes issues crop up at especially difficult hours, like long after or before typical business hours. You can think of voltage as a measure of electrical pressure. AFCIs (arc-fault circuit interrupters) protect against fire by continuously monitoring the electrical current in a circuit and shutting off the circuit when unintended arcing occurs.</p>

<p>This wiring as pre-existing or "old-work" electrical wiring, is still described in the U.S. National Electrical Code (2005) in Article 394. Many homes built before the 1960's are powered by electrical panels that are equipped with fuses. Fuse boxes are not as much of a concern as the fuses that you have to put in them.
