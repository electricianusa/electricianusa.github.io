Next, unroll the spool of low-voltage electrical cable and lay the cable beside the fixtures. With preventive maintenance, you'll not only save money on future repairs but also protect your family from the dangers of an electrical issue.</p>
<p>Keeping the lights closer to the transformer will help eliminate the voltage drop that occurs when lights are further away. The 24-hour service team at Blind & Sons is prepared to offer superior care at affordable prices, so never hesitate to call for any of your electrical needs.
