<p>There are certain specifications for electrical outlets, especially in kitchens where microwaves and other major appliances are plugged. Conditions exist in any transmission and distribution system that result in power losses in the systems and equipment that deliver power and in the systems and equipment that use power. To remove the defective switch, disconnect the two wires from the terminals by loosening the screws in a counter-clockwise direction. Be sure to tighten all wire nuts or terminal screws firmly and give each wire a tug test as you connect them.</p>
<p>Circuit breakers are designed to trip or cut-off power to the circuit when more amps are being drawn than the wire is rated to carry. Consider the power savings of LED bulbs to save money over time. You want to replace a half hot outlet with a switch (dimmer) to run some LED lights. Cutting through cables, drilling into wiring in the walls and trying to effect a repair while the appliance is still plugged in are just some of the causes of fatal electric shocks that occur each year in homes.</p>
