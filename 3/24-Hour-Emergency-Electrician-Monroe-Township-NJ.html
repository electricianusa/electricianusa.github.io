<p>A circuit breaker trip helps to stop the flow of electricity. A good rule of thumb is that if you upgrade your panel (the electrical service into your house) you should upgrade your wiring.

This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh). If you're noticing minor rust on your breaker panel's housing, have it inspected by an electrician. Electrical problems are among the leading causes of home fires in the United States alone.</p>
