Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>It also contains circuit breakers that detect dangerous power surges and cut the circuit's power to reduce the risks of damage and fires. They can run on a variety of fuel options, including propane and diesel, or even be hooked up to the municipal gas lines—that way, they run cleaner and don't emit the carbon monoxide fumes of portable generators.
