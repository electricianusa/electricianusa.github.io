When getting a back up generator, one of the first questions you must ask and answer is, "What type of fuel will I use?" Of course, gasoline is the most commonly used fuel but the problem with gas is; you can only store so much.</p>

If the location where you want your low voltage lights is some distance from the outlet, then you will need to purchase additional wiring and bury it. All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>
