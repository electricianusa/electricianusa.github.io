With our knack for design using quality LED lighting, we take pride in the fact that our customers trust us to design and create a beautiful nighttime effect for their house, landscape, or property that will enhance curb appeal and increase security. However, choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house is so stressful. Circuit breakers in the main panel cut power to individual circuits if they start to draw more current than is safe.</p>
<p>Repairs should never be made on live electrical circuits. The transfer switch also comes with a NEMA 3R enclosure that is suited for both indoor and outdoor installation. Though they work in different ways, they all protect the user against accidental electric shock and electrocution by acting immediately to shut off power to the appliance upon the detection of a leak‚Äù of electric current as may happen when a hair dryer falls into a sink full of water.

Whether you are home or away, a premium standby generator will keep you running during a power outage.
