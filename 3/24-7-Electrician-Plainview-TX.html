Conversely this also means the protector will absorb less and less energy as the harmful power is diverted into the ground. Portable generators are turned on manually whenever they're needed.

After any electrical wiring issues in your home have been repaired, take some time to learn about electricity and what to do in the case of an emergency.</p>
