Depending on your energy needs and the type of electrical panel being installed, costs may vary widely. The two conductor cable from the ceiling box to the light switch is supposed to have the white conductor re-identified with another color because it is not being used as a neutral, but as a hot wire.</p>
<p>The cost of labor is usually set by the local National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), although non-member electricians are not bound by their hourly wage. A GFCI outlet is an extremely sensitive outlet that monitors the current passing through it. If there's a slight change in current coming back from the equipment plugged into the outlet, the GFCI will automatically disconnect the circuit so the electrical current is no longer flowing. The landscape lighting that requires the greatest effort to install is 120-volt lighting.</p>
