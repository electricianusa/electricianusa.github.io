<p>You may want to consider purchasing a battery backup surge protector to safeguard your computer against potential loss of data during a momentary loss of power as a result of an electrical storm or accidental power outage.

All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>
