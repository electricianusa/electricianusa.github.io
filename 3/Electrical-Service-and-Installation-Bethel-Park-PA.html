<p>In a typical home, these events occur on a regular basis; they can damage unprotected devices instantly or over time. You need to understand that if you decide to install electrical wire, you're indeed playing with fire. Some transformers will have built-in timing switches to help you create a schedule for the lights to turn on and off. Title: ARTICLE 411 Low-Voltage Lighting.

If by chance someone plugs an electric heater, or something else into a receptacle outlet and it overloads the circuit, the circuit breaker will trip off.
