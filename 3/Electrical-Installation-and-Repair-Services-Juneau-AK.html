<p>Choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house is not easy. Many local governments mandate that businesses must hire a licensed electrician when doing any electrical work in commercial buildings, especially those used by the public. Keep the runs under 50 feet, and power should arrive at halogen fixtures in their sweet spot: 10.8 to 11.5 volts (for LEDs, 8 to 15 volts). Below: this is a sample of plastic-insulated multi-strand electrical wire that was encased in the rubber jacket shown above.</p>
<p>Journeyman License: 8,000 hours of working experience and successful completion of an examination is required.

Again, the ground wire always gets connected to the green screw, no matter the wiring scenario. In a typical household electrical circuit, the black circuit wires (and sometimes red) are the "hot" wires that carry power from the source to the switch or receptacle. For switches, you will need to first remove the switch and then touch the tester to the sides of all wires to ensure that none are live.</p>
