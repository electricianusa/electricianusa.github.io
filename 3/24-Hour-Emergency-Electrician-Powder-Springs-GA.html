<p>Labeling - If you are keen enough, you will find that electrical wires have letters on them. A benefit of something like an in-line coaxial surge protector, as opposed to traditional a surge protector, is that it can also store vital data concerning the power output of the specific equipment that it protects.

<p>In some instances, wiring colors are also applied in electrical wiring installation that does not adhere to the general rules of wiring. Information on the following pages includes important safety information and tips to follow for safely using electrical appliances and being safe around electricity. Residential electricity as an industry is fairly young; electrical systems have only been a standard installation in new homes since about 1930. Sometimes homeowners choose to upgrade service while doing another project, such as burying an overhead power line.</p>
<p>You do not need to be an expert contractor to install your lighting system. And surge protection plays a more important role than ever before. Portable generators must be at least 15 feet away from your home. Only a licensed and experienced electrician should perform major electrical projects such as an upgrade and rewiring of the home. First, though portable generators are cheaper, they do have their issues: In the Consumer Reports survey, 22% of people who had portable generators ran out of fuel, 10% said the generator didn't power what they needed it to, and 9% said it didn't start at all; meanwhile, nearly nine in 10 consumers with standby generators were highly satisfied” with their purchase.</p>
