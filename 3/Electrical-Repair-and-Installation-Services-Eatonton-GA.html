<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>

Another method that is not recommended is the loop, or lollipop,” which is basically a daisy chain with the wire run from the last fixture looped back to the first fixture or transformer tap. Before you shop for a new switch, remove your old one from the box—after making sure the power is off, of course—and look for a neutral white wire.</p>

Problems that appear minor on the surface sometimes cause major safety issues down the road. There is no state licensing for journeyman and contractors however working in New York City, you need to get a license issued through the Department of Buildings.</p>

Whatever style you choose, pick box sizes that have a volume of at least 20 cu. in.
