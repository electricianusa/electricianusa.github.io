With our monthly lighting inspection, the Alameda Electric team works in partnership with your team to represent your property in the best possible way. Whether you've just bought a new home, are tired of dealing with faulty electricity, or have gotten a notice from the city, our electricians at Fox & Sons can help bring your breaker panel up to code quickly and affordably.</p>
