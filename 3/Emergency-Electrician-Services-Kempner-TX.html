We offer Design and Electrical Services with latest technology for LV & HV panels, tailor made to suit customer requirements. If you do have to use electricity outside, where it might be wet (like when you're replacing outdoor light bulbs, hanging holiday lights or trimming trees), always wear shoes that have rubber soles, and make sure you only use weatherproof extension cords deemed suitable for outdoor use.</p>
<p>Pendant lights are a great option if you are looking to install task lighting. Electrical cords and extension cords should never be run across a doorway or underneath a rug or carpet. Whatever the source of fuel chosen, one thing is certain and that is that having backup electrical power available on-demand can greatly reduce the anxiety associated with an unexpected power outage. These devices often have photo cells or timers that control when the lights turn on, so you don't have to flip a switch every night.</p>
<p>Using surge protectors extends the life of appliances and electronics by as much as 30%. Alternative power generation, such as solar and wind, is an emerging field that should require more electricians for installation. We are happy to answer any questions you may have, and can also schedule a convenient time for you to meet a highly trained, experienced electrician in your area. An electric service upgrade is often recommended or required to increase the capacity of the existing electrical service.</p>
