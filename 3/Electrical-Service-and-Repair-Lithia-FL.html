Help maintain a fire resistant home by monitoring and organizing your electrical cords to prevent unnecessary damage. Standby generators are designed for better fuel efficiency.

As the Bay Area continues to deal with PG&E cutting power on short notice, the value of a backup generator will increase to potential buyers.</p>
<p>Our home generator installation and services can provide you with some much needed electricity in the event of a blackout or even be used to supplement a solar system and abandon the grid totally.

<p>Planned generator maintenance is vital to the reliable operation of any power generation system. The landscape lights are cheaper than the high voltage incandescent lights when it comes to initial installation, as they would not require certain conduit just to house their wirings. You can open them, look at them, and replace a fuse or restart a circuit breaker without hurting anything. That said a home backup generator is a powerful tool to help ensure that a home or business does not experience an interruption in electrical power at the worst possible time.</p>

Master Electrician: You need to have at least 5 years of experience, equaling 10,000 hours, in commercial, residential, or industrial work.
