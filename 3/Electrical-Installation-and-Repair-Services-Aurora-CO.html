<h3>Lightning Damages and Protection Practices in Aurora CO</h3>
<p>For instance, when a television is plugged into a lightning surge protection piece, and a heavy burst of electricity strikes the pole that connects to the house, the protector detects the high amount of voltage and switches the piece off, protecting the television from the attack.
