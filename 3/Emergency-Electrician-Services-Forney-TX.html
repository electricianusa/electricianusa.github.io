Bottom line: I recommend that you purchase a new high-quality surge protector (#ad) to protect your new computer from routine power surges and distant lightning strikes. I think it's safe to say that in general it's common practice to use a twist-on connector to splice pigtails or individual wires at an individual hot or neutral wire where more connections are needed than fit with the original wire.</p>
