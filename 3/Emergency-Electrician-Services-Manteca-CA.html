<p>It is important to plan ahead when installing low voltage lighting so that you can avoid any potential problems, especially with the setup. Tell children that electric cords should be left alone. Portable generators employ propane or gas tanks. Installing a home generator is not as easy as simply plugging it in. In fact, the installation process can be quite complex. The worst time to try installing a portable generator for the first time is in the dark after your power has already gone out.</p>
