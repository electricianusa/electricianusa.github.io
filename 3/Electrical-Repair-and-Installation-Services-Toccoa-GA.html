Aaron's Electrical Service is available to troubleshoot and repair your ceiling lights and overhead light fixtures in the Houston area.

Measure voltage on 3-phase Wye and Delta connected circuits and calculate percent phase imbalance as part of troubleshooting motors. You must have at least 12,000 hours of on-the-job training under the supervision of a master electrician.</p>
<p>Residential master electrician: To get this license, you must have two years' worth of working experience in wiring a single or two-family home or two years of education and training.

<p>It's that you should, make sure that your computers are safely off, before you attempt to do any electrical work to your home. The electrical panel needs to replaced or upgraded if it no longer has the capacity to accommodate modern electronics and appliances. Surge protectors are more affordable than many homeowners realize, and they can save you thousands of dollars by preventing premature system failure. While some power strips and individual surge protectors can save some of your electronics, our Dallas electricians recommend a whole house surge protection that can cover all your home's electrical appliances.</p>
