<p>An electrical technician who can systematically troubleshoot and safely repair their plant's equipment will ultimately add to their organizations' bottom line.

Never use extension cords under rugs or carpet, near high-traffic areas, wrapped around table or chair legs, through doorways or anywhere they can be pinched, flattened or severed. This is a new area for the Building Regulations and is called Part P (electrical safety).
