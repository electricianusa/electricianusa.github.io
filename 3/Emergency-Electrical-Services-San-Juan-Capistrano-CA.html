<p>For instance, when a television is plugged into a lightning surge protection piece, and a heavy burst of electricity strikes the pole that connects to the house, the protector detects the high amount of voltage and switches the piece off, protecting the television from the attack. Low voltage systems that use LEDs for general lighting can rely on integral emergency battery packs for emergency power These are UL Component Recognized in the U.S. and Canada, and thus are compatible with LED lighting systems.</p>
<p>Brint Electric is dedicated to helping those customers in need by providing commercial and industrial emergency electrical service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If there is no neutral wire in the switch box, such as in the diagram at the top of this page, you likely cannot use a smart switch.

The easiest way to determine which type of dimmer you will need is to find out how many switches control your light fixtures.</p>
