<p>The maximum number of lighting units that can be connected to the secondary of the power supply is based on the wattage of the lamps. South Dakota Codified Law (SDCL) 20:44:14:01(12) defines an "owner's exemption" as an exemption from licensure requirements for an individual owner who is personally installing electrical wiring and fixtures in a residence or farmstead which is owned and resided in or on by the person installing the electrical wiring or fixtures.</p>
