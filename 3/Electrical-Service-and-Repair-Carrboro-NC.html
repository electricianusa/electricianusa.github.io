This course covers the operation and maintenance of high-voltage circuit breakers and switchgear (4 KV and above) that are typically used for in-plant distribution of electrical power. If you don't have adequate knowledge of the numerous wirings of the electrical panel, make sure you contact Mr. Electric for the circuit breaker repair.</p>

Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
