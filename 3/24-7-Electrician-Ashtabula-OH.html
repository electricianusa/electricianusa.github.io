All of the power for your home comes through this panel from the utility company to the exit wires that split off and service different parts of the house. You are building a room (such as a bathroom or closet) in the same area as the existing electrical panel: Since the electrical code does not allow for an electrical panel to be located within a bathroom or a closet, no matter the size, this could be a reason for relocating the electrical panel.

You can also wire it up so that the switch controls the outlet and the light it's connected to, which may be useful if you have a lamp plugged into the outlet.
