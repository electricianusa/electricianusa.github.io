These indoor units are manufactured with secondary input connections that are compatible with wiring methods from NEC chapter 3, such as those that include ½ inch knockouts or NM cable clamp, permitting compliance with 411.4. Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>If you find that you have one particular circuit that seems to inexplicably shut off, even with no significant electrical load on it, then you may need to replace a faulty breaker. Always best to disconnect power, but issues of insulation failure, lack of proper grounding, lack of GFCI, out-of-code wiring, generator operating without transfer switch, and other problems pose a risk to anyone working on electric power. Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>
<p>Your electrical system affects your entire home or business and faulty wiring done by an unskilled electrician, is a fire hazard.
