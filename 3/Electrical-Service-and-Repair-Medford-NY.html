<p>These outlets are designed to disrupt the power to electrical outlets when heat or moisture is detected. Fortunately, with the help of an electrician, you can add 220-volt service to your home, or run more 220 circuits if you need to add extra outlets. Electrical Trade students at Fortis are instructed in the professional skills and knowledge they'll need to enter the workforce as residential, commercial or industrial electricians, trained in safe work habits as well as OSHA and National Electric Code compliance standards.</p>
