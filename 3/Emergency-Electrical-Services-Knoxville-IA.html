Some solar-powered lights even come with mounting screws and brackets that allow you to mount the light to the wall.

If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them.
