<p>And, no one knows generators better than Diamond Electric. Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second.

Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
