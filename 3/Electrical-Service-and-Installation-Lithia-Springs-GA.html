When you hire a qualified electrician for an electrical inspection, they will test the circuits that run to the outlets and switches for signs of damage. If you've noticed that the wires inside of your walls are fraying, it's definitely time to replace them.

<p>Regardless of what a particular project is going to be, great lighting schemes are a result of a lighting designer that is a master of their medium, since they can meld technology, science, and artistry into one impressive package.

<p>I temporarily screwed in a a couple of metal tabs (cut from scrap - or you can use a small angle bracket) to the wall-plate screw holes (the support bar from a fan outlet box will also work ). The tabs held the box flush with the drywall and kept it from falling in while I screwed them into the studs.
