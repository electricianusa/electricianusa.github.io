<p>When doing auto electrical repair, the first vehicle component your should acquire knowledge about is the car battery.

<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>Your Electrician should know about this when they come to service your home, because the cost of a service or panel upgrade in five years may be a game changer. As you add electrical appliances and circuits, you increase the demand on your power panel.
