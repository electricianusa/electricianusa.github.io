<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire.

Thankfully, there is an economical solution available: whole-home surge protection, a breaker added to your main electrical panel by a Lee Company certified electrician.</p>

A water fountain can be enhanced with a spotlight (Image 2), and a pond can have soft lighting around its perimeter. Their power strip looks like any other surge suppressor but it has two outlets that receive a continuous current while the remaining six (or eight depending on the model) can be turned on or off with a remote.
