<p>Those who work in maintenance and remodeling typically repair and replace faulty equipment. Let's dive into what low voltage lighting is, how it's different from line voltage lighting, and the pros and cons of using this kind of system in your space. Although an electrical contractor in either field needs to be licensed and knowledgeable, he or she will have somewhat different areas of specialization, as homes and businesses require different forms of maintenance.</p>

A generator takes energy from a fuel source and uses the principle of electromagnetic induction that was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831 to turn it into electrical energy.</p>
<p>A generator is a back-up electrical system that operates regardless of if you are at home or away. We are fully state certified, licensed, and insured to handle any electrical installation or repair at your home or office.
