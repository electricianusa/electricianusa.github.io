<p>And even if your breaker box is just getting old, it's a good idea to have an electrician look at it so that you can plan ahead and do the upgrades before you have an electrical problem. If you are noticing frequent circuit breaker trips, it may be coming from an old panel that cannot deliver enough electrical power for a modern home. They come in different sizes, and it's important to make sure the right size wire is connected to the right size circuit breaker.</p>
<p>With 25 years of experience servicing our New Jersey customers, we can repair just about any generator, so if yours needs a professional touch to keep it running during the most crucial times, let us know. If your current box doesn't have enough circuits to meet your household needs, putting in a new breaker panel is a practical solution.
