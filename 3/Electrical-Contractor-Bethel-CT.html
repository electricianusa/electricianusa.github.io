<p>Call us for an electrical panel upgrade quote or if you have specific questions regarding whether your home or business needs an upgrade. It's important to remember that the blowing of a fuse, or the tripping of a circuit breaker, is actually a built-in safety precaution for your home that disrupts electrical flow and helps to prevent overloaded wiring from causing a fire. Advanced sound dampening and a low-tone muffler make it one of the quietest whole house generators in its class, and it has a noise level of 63 dB only.</p>

<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
