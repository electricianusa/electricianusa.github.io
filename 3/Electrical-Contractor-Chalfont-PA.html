It will then take another two years as a journeyman (with a total of 4,000 hours of additional work under a contractor, including a minimum of 2,000 hours of commercial work) to write the electrical contractor's exam.</p>
<p>If your home still relies on an old-fashioned panel with fuses, which is common in homes built prior to 1960, then you probably want to upgrade to an electrical panel with circuit breakers.
