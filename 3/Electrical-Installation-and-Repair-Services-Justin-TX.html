Target just the breakers that handle power for the light fixtures ( $205 at Amazon ) and switches you plan to service. Utility companies incur significant upfront costs to start supplying utility services by purchasing power and water equipment and installing a distribution network. If the power demand for a circuit approaches the amps the circuit is rated for, the circuit breaker will trip and shut down power to the circuit, because there is a danger of the wiring overheating.</p>
<p>It could also be used to supply power to another switch that controls lights in another part of the house.
