Once you're sure that power is shut off to the wire that will be fed into the old-work box, insert the old-work box into the drywall opening with the power wire running through the drywall opening and fed through the old-work box with at least six to seven inches of the wire exposed (you can use a wire stripper to strip the wire ). Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
