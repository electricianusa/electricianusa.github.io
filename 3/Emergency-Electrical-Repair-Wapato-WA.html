<p>Many states require seven years of experience as an electrician or a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering for certification as a master electrician. It is recommended to use a higher transformer wattage and larger cable size to allow for adding more lights. Master Electrician - You must have at least four years of experience as a licensed journeyman electrician. Attaching fixtures to one cable in a daisy chain can overpower the lights closest to the transformer and leave the last few power-starved and dim.</p>
<p>Journeyman License: 8,000 hours of working experience and successful completion of an examination is required. Each year, electrical failures or malfunctions cause more than 50,000 home fires in the United States, resulting in 450 deaths, nearly 1,500 injuries and more than $1.5 billion in property damage, according to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).
