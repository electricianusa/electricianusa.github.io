<p>Legrand provides the most complete line of residential, commercial and industrial electrical wiring devices in the world. Older homes often lack sufficient electrical circuits to meet the demand of modern life. Leave your electrical panel replacement needs to the professionals at Electric Man.

Aluminum wiring used in the 60s and 70s, non-metallic wiring installed in the 40s and 50s, and knob and tube wiring in pre-1930s homes are well-known safety hazards, as are loose connections and frayed wires resulting from wear-and-tear.</p>
