We offer Design and Electrical Services with latest technology for LV & HV panels, tailor made to suit customer requirements. If you do have to use electricity outside, where it might be wet (like when you're replacing outdoor light bulbs, hanging holiday lights or trimming trees), always wear shoes that have rubber soles, and make sure you only use weatherproof extension cords deemed suitable for outdoor use.</p>
