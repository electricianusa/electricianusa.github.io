Circuit Breakers have a big advantage over fuses in that if thy are tripped they can be easily reset by simply flipping the switch to the offf position and then back to the on position.

If a homeowner only wants to replace outlets and switches, then he or she probably shouldn't waste time calling commercial electricians that wire large buildings.</p>
