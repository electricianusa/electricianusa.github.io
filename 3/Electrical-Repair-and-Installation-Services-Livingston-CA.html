Understanding what your expected load is in the event of a power outage is a key component of choosing the right generator.

<p>If it is, though, you can make any or all of the outlets half hots. We will review your unique situation and offer you an honest estimate on an electrical service upgrade that we guarantee will be completed on schedule. Outlets that have moisture in them may create a shock hazard. If your devices are hit with a power surge, the excess power could easily burn them out, rendering them useless.
