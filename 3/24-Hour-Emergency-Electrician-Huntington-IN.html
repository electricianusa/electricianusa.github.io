Actually, your neighborhood would be more prepared if inexpensive home standby generators were found at your homes. If a lightning strike does occur on your property and it interferes with your electrical system than thousands of volts are going to immediately fry absolutely everything that is connected to it like laptops, TVs, and lights.</p>
<p>When an outage occurs, the switch is triggered (usually automatically in the case of an automatic transfer switch, but some models require a manual switch flip) and switches from utility power to the generator, which turns on automatically when the switch engages. Since a traditional knob and tube electrical circuit lacks a ground wire, these circuits should be upgraded to new wire whenever possible. An electrician can help make wiring a light switch hassle-free.</p>
