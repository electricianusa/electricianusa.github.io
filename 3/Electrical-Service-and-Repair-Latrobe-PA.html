<p>Defined simply, a joule is a measurement of how much energy transfers through electrical currents going back and forth between a wall outlet and a home appliance or entertainment device. Keep hairdryers, curling irons, electric razors, electric toothbrushes and other appliances away from water. Large appliances like refrigerators, stoves, window air conditioners, washers and dryers should never be plugged in with extension cords or power strips. Either remember this in your head or mark the wires with electrical tape.</p>
<p>Look in the fuse box or breaker box and see what rating the fuse is set at, look on the outer sheathing on the wire and see what its rating is. If you are continually resetting breakers or replacing fuses then there is likely to be a fault and more current is trying to be drawn than the circuit is designed for.
