<p>The black wires are the power (or hot”) wires, the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires, and the bare copper wire is the ground wire. History of electrical wire & electrical wiring: how to recognize knob and tube electrical wiring and unsafe "extension cord" wiring. Placement of the electrical box is guided by The National Electric Codes produced through The National Fire Protection Association.

Plus they run on natural gas or propane, which means they can operate for days or weeks on a full whole-house propane tank, or indefinitely in the case of natural-gas versions.

<p>All that is necessary there is to either replace the outlet OR to jumper the bottom half onto the top half and cap off the switched wire, leaving it unused in the box. With the outlet, I used a receptacle that allows for side wiring (traditional), or back-wiring (not back-stab, but where there's a plate under the screw that clamps down on the wires). Do check that there aren't some bare wires nutted together, with no insulation on them at all, though - those would be ground.</p>
