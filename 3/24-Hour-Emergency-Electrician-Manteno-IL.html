<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Contractor in Manteno</h2>
<p>Electrical contracting is a massive industry valued at more than $130 billion annually. My best advice is to have all the wiring evaluated by a licensed electrician for safety, preferable one that is familiar with aluminum and if you can keep from changing out receptacles, switches and lighting that would be best, just don't mess with it. I know if you are doing a complete rehab, you will want to change out lights, old and dirty light switches and receptacles with many coats of paint, but if you can clean them up, you are better off.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, do not put the lights closer than 10 feet from a pool, spa or pond.
