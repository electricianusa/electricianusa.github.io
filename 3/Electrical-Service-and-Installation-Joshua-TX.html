<p>The Standard for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting Systems, UL 1838, covers the safety requirements for landscape lighting systems; the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems, UL 2108, covers incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings; and the Standard for Low Voltage Lighting Systems for Use in Recreational Vehicles, UL 234, covers luminaires for recreational vehicles.
