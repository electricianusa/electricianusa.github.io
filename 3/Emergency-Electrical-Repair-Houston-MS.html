<p>They require professional installation and either a natural gas or liquid propane fuel source. Low-voltage lighting is versatile because you can mix any fixture types you want along the same transformer line, from patio wall lights to walkway lights. During a power outage, run a cord from the backup generator to the inlet, flip a manual transfer switch on the subpanel, and all the designated circuits will have power. After removing the panel and all of the breakers, the electrician will check to ensure that all wiring is sound and grounded.</p>
