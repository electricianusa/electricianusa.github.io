<h3>Light Fixture Installation & Repair Hudson FL 34667</h3>
<p>This diverts any electrical leaks from exposed live wires safely to the earth rather than through you. This wiring option isn't complicated by any means; it's just a bit more involved than plug-and-play connectors as it requires the use of wire cutters and strippers to tie into your main landscape line.

<p>Purchasing a transformer with a higher maximum wattage capacity will come in handy if you want to add more lights later. The higher watt bulbs of the 120 volt systems are problematic in the fact that they create unwanted glare and reduces your ability to create subtle landscape lighting effects and much more expensive to operate moreover flexibility low voltage fixtures can be moved to different location easily VS high voltage needs j-boxes & wiring to work.</p>
<p>Installation is virtually complex free - unlike other electronic systems, the installation for this type is relatively easy. Lighting around pools can create a nice mirroring effect off the water or create a tropical feel. Even if you're comfortable working with electrical tools and equipment, remember you should always proceed with caution.
