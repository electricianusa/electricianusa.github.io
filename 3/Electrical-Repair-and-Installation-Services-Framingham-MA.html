<p>Outlets and switches can be easily overlooked in your home, but these functional pieces of hardware let you light, ventilate and power your appliances. GFCI breakers work by sensing differences in electricity that flows into a circuit, caused by contact with humans or water. While there are many different colors and types of materials being used within the solar lights, a flagstone pathway can be nicely illuminated with metal or copper lighting fixtures. However, they require slightly different wiring than a single switch and are a bit more expensive to replace.
