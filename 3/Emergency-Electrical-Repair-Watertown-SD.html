Aluminum wiring used in the 60s and 70s, non-metallic wiring installed in the 40s and 50s, and knob and tube wiring in pre-1930s homes are well-known safety hazards, as are loose connections and frayed wires resulting from wear-and-tear.</p>

The course will examine troubleshooting from the controller, including a review of basic safety procedures, and the selection of test instruments. Sudden bursts of electricity can irreversibly damage electronics. For electrical safety reasons, it's good to know how old your home is and to celebrate its birthday with an electrical safety inspection. Landscape lighting is intended to reveal what the night hides and should enhance the property, extend the hours of enjoyment and provide security and safety for property owners and guests.</p>
