Most extension cords aren't built to handle high-powered items such as air conditioners, refrigerators, or space heaters. For internal surface installation switches shall be provided with matching steel box and shall be with metal clad finish. From there, circuits carry all the needed electricity to the appliances, lights, and outlets in your home. An electrical sub panel - also known as a service sub panel or circuit breaker sub panel - is often required to create new space for circuit breakers and to optimize your electrical system.</p>

Many old electrical service panels are rated for about 60 amps, while new homes often have 200 amp panels or even higher.</p>
