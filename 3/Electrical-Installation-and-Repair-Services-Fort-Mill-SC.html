If your panel is warm, has a burnt smell, or burn marks, these are all signs of a prehistoric panel that is not equipped to handle the amount of power that is flowing through it. This can cause a server issue of a house fire and other home issues.</p>
<p>If you calculate a number higher than your current service panel, an upgrade is in order. This is the amount of current that is allowed to pass through to electronic devices after the damaging currents have been diverted into the ground.

Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage.
