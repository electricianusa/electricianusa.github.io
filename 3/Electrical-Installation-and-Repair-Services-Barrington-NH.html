<p>I believe that's how it was, and yes the switch works in its updated function of controlling the ceiling lights. More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps.

<p>Power or communications cables (e.g., computer networking) that are routed in or through air-handling spaces (plenums) of office buildings are required under the model building code to be either encased in metal conduit, or rated for low flame and smoke production. The half hot outlet will have both a permanent hot and a neutral in it. Additional outlets can be powered from either that or the switch box by using the permanent hot and the neutral from either the switch box or the outlet box.</p>
