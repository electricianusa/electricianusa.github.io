That's exactly what Schneider Electric does with the ‘Connected Power' badge within the EcoXpert partner program: help electrical contractors tap into the clear benefits by training them in acquiring these skillsets and, at least as important, understand the existing connected power solutions such as smart panels, smart metering and the energy management and efficiency systems in the cloud , which make all the difference from the contractor, customer and optimization and services perspective.</p>
