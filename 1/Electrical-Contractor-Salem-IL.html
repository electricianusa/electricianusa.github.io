<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Salem</h2>

To determine which size transformer you need, simply add up the wattage of all the lights in the system. Or, you can show 8,000 hours of experience from outside the state. Choose the wire that goes to the unswitched half of the outlet or, if the entire outlet is switched and there is an extra black in the box that is not being used you might try that one. What ever your goals are it is best to make a plan and design your low voltage outdoor lighting system to achieve your goals.</p>

<p>Although most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, some start out by attending a technical school. They range from expensive architectural grade deck light fixtures with metal housings and baked on finish for long years of use to systems with plastic housings at a lower cost and shorter life span. Tip: If there are two switches mounted side by side in the junction box or two switches on one unit, be sure that the circuit governing both switches are turned off.</p>
