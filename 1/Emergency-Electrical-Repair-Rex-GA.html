<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Service in Rex</h2>
<p>A home's electrical system is routinely inspected at the time of purchase, in fact, usually more than once. To determine which size transformer you need, simply add up the wattage of all the lights in the system. Or, you can show 8,000 hours of experience from outside the state. Choose the wire that goes to the unswitched half of the outlet or, if the entire outlet is switched and there is an extra black in the box that is not being used you might try that one. What ever your goals are it is best to make a plan and design your low voltage outdoor lighting system to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>If they are hot with the top wired, but not the bottom, then you can probably wire the outlet as a half hot.
