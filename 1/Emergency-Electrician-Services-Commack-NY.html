Having malfunctioning outlets can be a serious shock and fire hazard.</p>

Recent Review: This the second time we have called Gabe to perform electrical work for us and everything was completed as promised. Mike M., however, thinks it would be a better idea to run 120-volt AC power to areas where DC was needed and install transformers there.
