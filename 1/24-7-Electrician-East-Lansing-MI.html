<h3>Outlet & Light Switch Install East Lansing MI 48823</h3>

<p>This involves determining the specific locations of each light and its outdoor power source. This is not to be confused with tinned copper wiring which has a dull silver finish, but this was used in a much earlier time. If your home wiring circuits are not so identified, the time required to make up such a record will be saved many times over as fuse replacements, fixture alterations and other repairs become necessary. Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>
<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>

Some switches will have slots that you can slide a straight wire into and tighten it down with the screw, which is definitely easier than wrapping the hooked wire around the screw.</p>
