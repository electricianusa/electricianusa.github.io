Greater safety - The electrical equipment in your home—wiring, outlets, etc.—is rarely taken care of properly, resulting in wires deteriorating and a greater chance of malfunctioning. Before pursuing an electrical project any further, it is important to test your home for grounded wiring.</p>

The result is damaging surges traveling to important electronics elsewhere in the house.</p>
