Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>
<p>And along with our emergency, after hour service, Penny Electric still offers fair rates, up-front pricing and professional, fully trained electricians to ensure fast, reliable repairs.
