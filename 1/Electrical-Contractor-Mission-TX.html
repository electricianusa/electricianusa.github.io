Your home has different types of electrical circuits installed that serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Additionally, some folks try to hide extension cords under rugs, carpets, furniture, and other items. 10 to 15 feet total cable length is pretty much the limit with a single tap 12 volt transformer however with a transformer running at 22 volts you can often have several 100 feet of cable.
