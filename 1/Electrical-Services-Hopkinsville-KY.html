Outdoor lighting brightens walkways and gives your home a safer, more welcoming appearance.</p>

That reduces the chance of electrical shock and means it's safer to install and maintain than a standard-voltage lighting system, says Terry McGowan, director of engineering and technology for the American Lighting Association.</p>
<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting.

If you go a long period without needing your portable backup generator, you may spend a lot of money on gasoline you cannot use.</p>
