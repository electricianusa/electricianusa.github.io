I will be upgrading the electrical panel in my home from 100 to 200 amps. In older homes, outdated electrical work may not be up to code, and today's greater electrical needs can result in overloaded circuits. The best solution is to have a standby generator system installed.</p>

This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh). If you're noticing minor rust on your breaker panel's housing, have it inspected by an electrician. Electrical problems are among the leading causes of home fires in the United States alone.</p>

<p>If your electrical usage is expected to go up significantly, you will need to do this upgrade. Our skilled electricians will hang your ceiling fan on your existing preinstalled fan box, or install new wiring, switches and a fan-rated brace box for any area of your home. If that's the case, you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and a ground wire connected to the outlet. It's imperative that the size of the wires you choose matches the amperage of the circuit.</p>
<p>It is common for landscape lighting to stop working and usually a simple repair can bring yard lights back to life. Tracing electrical wiring in walls can be tricky, and it involves more than just looking for the wires themselves.
