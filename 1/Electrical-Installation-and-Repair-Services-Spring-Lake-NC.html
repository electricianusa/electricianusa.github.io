<p>When it comes to evaluating electricians, Texas residents have an easy choice: A&H Electric's certified electricians in Conroe, is the electrical service company that is known throughout the area for quality workmanship and superior service. As defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) , a ''relay'' is "a device that is operated by a variation in the conditions of one electric circuit to affect the operation of other devices in the same or another electric circuit." A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit."
