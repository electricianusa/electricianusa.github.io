Auto electricians specialize in cars and commercial vehicles The auto electrical trade is generally more difficult than the electrical trade due to the confined spaces, engineering complexity of modern automotive electrical systems, and working conditions (often roadside breakdowns or on construction sites, mines, quarries to repair machinery etc.) Also the presence of high-current DC electricity makes injury from burns and arc-flash injury possible.</p>
<p>We get it, there can be a ton of confusion when it comes to different types of electricians. If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway.

Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>

Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
