<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Slidell</h2>
<p>PART 1 OF 2: In this video, Master electrician Scott Caron shows the first phase of replacing an antiquated electrical system. If your home has two-prong outlets, there's no safe way to update them to modern three-prong outlets, short of calling a licensed electrician.

<p>The screws also bore into holes on the electrical box behind them. There are dozens of low-voltage lighting fixtures and accessories available in a variety of styles, sizes, colors, and finishes. Because many homeowners don't understand how an electrical panel works, they put themselves in grave risk of being electrocuted.
