<p>Check all electric cords for visible damage. Ask a professional to install electrical wiring. The first being associated with large scale electrical systems like electrical networks power systems and the latter associated with smaller scale electronic systems like computers and small circuits.

<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG.

<p>Defined simply, a joule is a measurement of how much energy transfers through electrical currents going back and forth between a wall outlet and a home appliance or entertainment device. Keep hairdryers, curling irons, electric razors, electric toothbrushes and other appliances away from water. Large appliances like refrigerators, stoves, window air conditioners, washers and dryers should never be plugged in with extension cords or power strips. Either remember this in your head or mark the wires with electrical tape.</p>
