As you prepare for a career as an electrician, Electrical Wiring I of the electrical wiring series will provide training in the installation of residential electrical circuits.

<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>If you open the panel, you'll see circuit breakers arranged in two columns. A master electrician license authorizes electricians to pull permits, design electrical systems, supervise job sites and other electricians- and apply for an independent electrical contractor's license.
