Central air-conditioners also draw heavy current and the installation of one may require the upgrading of the electrical service. You'll learn all of the pro techniques for a wiring job, including choosing the right size receptacle boxes, running cable throughout the room, and making the electrical connections. For your Electrical Licence in NSW you will need to hold a Cert III in Electrotechnology (Electrician), a Certificate of Proficiency in Elecrotechnology (Electrician) plus 12 months local experience working under the supervision of a licensed electrician.</p>
<p>If you are overloading your outlets, you may need to install a new circuit.

If you don't have adequate knowledge of the numerous wirings of the electrical panel, make sure you contact Mr. Electric for the circuit breaker repair.</p>
