Next, unroll the spool of low-voltage electrical cable and lay the cable beside the fixtures. With preventive maintenance, you'll not only save money on future repairs but also protect your family from the dangers of an electrical issue.</p>
<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2. A good rule of thumb is to use less than 90% of a transformer's capacity; this will increase the life of both the transformer and the light fixtures that are attached to it. Instead, you must have a generator transfer switch installed in advance. For homes with existing standby generators, these units do require replacement over time.</p>
