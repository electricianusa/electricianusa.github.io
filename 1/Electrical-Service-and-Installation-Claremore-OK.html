All of our trained electrical contractor professionals are committed to delivering the same standards of quality to residential customers throughout all of our service areas. If your panel is warm, has a burnt smell, or burn marks, these are all signs of a prehistoric panel that is not equipped to handle the amount of power that is flowing through it.

<h3>How Electrical Contractors Can Give Back to the Claremore OK Community</h3>
<p>At Hoffman Electrical, we provide commercial standby generator installation and repair, so your Clearwater business can stay open when your competitors can't. In addition, you can get surge protectors specifically designed for phone and cable lines. Find out who's doing the work: You'll want to know if the electrician does the job themselves, if they employ helpers or apprentices, or if they use subcontractors. Offering good illumination while not overpowering you, low voltage systems are ideal for the twilight hours.</p>
<p>However, surge protective panels or strips alone are not enough to fight damaging power surges. Finding out that your standby generator isn't working after a storm or power outage is too late. For example, if each light is 5 watts and you have 10 lights, your total wattage is 50. You want a transformer that is 20% larger than what you need. Attach the loose end of the new wire to the silver screw on the new outlet. Uncover the ends of the cable wire close to the transformer and connect them to the transformer's terminals.</p>

Just make sure that you match the polarity of your wires to the transformer. A multi-fuel generator could be very useful during an natural disaster when certain gases could be in short supply.
