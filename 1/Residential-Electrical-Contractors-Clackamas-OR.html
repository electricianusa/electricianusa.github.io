Limited Electrician - You must have completed an approved electrical study program of at least 576 hours. A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V). When a threshold is over 120V, a surge protector shorts to ground voltage or blocks the voltage.</p>

The experts at MX Electric have provided safe and efficient panel upgrades in Champaign for more than 20 years.

Your home is divided into various electrical zones, each of which has a circuit particular to your electrical needs in that area.
