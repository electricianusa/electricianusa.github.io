A surge protector is an electrical device that is used to protect equipment against power surges and voltage spikes while blocking voltage over a safe threshold (approximately 120 V). When a threshold is over 120V, a surge protector shorts to ground voltage or blocks the voltage.</p>
<p>Referring to purpose, intended use or space; typical applications include office lighting, retail lighting, gallery lighting, warehouse lighting, and more.

Your home is divided into various electrical zones, each of which has a circuit particular to your electrical needs in that area.
