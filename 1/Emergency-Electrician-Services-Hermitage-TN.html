In fact all wiring should only be done by a certified professional electrician. Portable generators provide power in remote locations, such as construction sites, for short periods of time. If you have a home that's older than 30 years and all of the electrical is original to the house, this is an aspect of home maintenance that you should be aware of. Circuit breakers that are old might not have enough capacity to keep up with today's needs, or you might even have a fuse box, which is an outdated system.</p>

Another fact to remember is that electricity always tries to find the easiest path to the ground. Our electricians can upgrade your current electrical panel to meet your growing needs.

<p>You can also call 1-800-624-4488 and speak with one of our knowledgeable staff members for more advice on landscape lighting. Power from your utility company flows into your home through this panel, where it branches out into major electrical branches, dwindling into smaller branches in order to distribute power. However, there are some differences between installing low voltage outdoor lighting systems and installing light fixtures in your home. GFCIs (ground-fault circuit interrupters) can greatly reduce the risk of shock by immediately shutting off an electrical circuit when that circuit represents a shock hazard (i.e., a person comes in contact with a faulty appliance together with a grounded surface).</p>
<p>Before purchasing, make sure a trained technician visits your home to assess your power needs, living area cubic footage, home electrical system, appliances, and possible installation issues. Installing a home backup generator is a great way to improve emergency preparedness in your household and keep your family comfortable in the case of a natural disaster or power outage. Breaker: circuit breaker is overcurrent protection that will trip when amp draw from Load or short circuit overheats wire.</p>
