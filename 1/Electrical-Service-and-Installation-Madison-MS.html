<p>You could even add half hot outlets by using a 3 rope wire with black, red, white and green if you would like to. Two of my living room outlets, for instance, are operated from the same switch. I have another neighbor who leaves several safety lights on all night long. These tasks, though important, are only one of the many electricians might tackle.

<p>Pendant lights are a great option if you are looking to install task lighting. Electrical cords and extension cords should never be run across a doorway or underneath a rug or carpet. Whatever the source of fuel chosen, one thing is certain and that is that having backup electrical power available on-demand can greatly reduce the anxiety associated with an unexpected power outage. These devices often have photo cells or timers that control when the lights turn on, so you don't have to flip a switch every night.</p>
<p>Even when you shut off the main breaker, the lugs still carry live electricity. Electrical panels do more than distribute electrical power to the many different devices thru your home, they protect you against electrical shorts and circuits overloads that can cause a fire.
