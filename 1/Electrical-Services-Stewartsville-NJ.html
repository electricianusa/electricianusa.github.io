According to the National Fire Protection Association, an average of 53,000 electrical home structure fires occur each year, claiming more than 450 lives, injuring more than 1,400 people, and causing more than $1.4 billion in property damage (National Fire Protection Association, 2002-2006).</p>
<p>Take note that appliances have also been a common cause of fire, so proper usage guidelines should be followed and electrical overloads should be avoided. A kite and its string may conduct electricity - sending it right through you to the ground.
