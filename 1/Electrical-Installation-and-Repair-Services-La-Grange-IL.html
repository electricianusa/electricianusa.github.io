Finally, while there are dimmable fluorescent light bulbs available for some other fixtures, I haven't yet run across any fluorescent under cabinet lights which are dimmable, so if this is important to you, you should probably consider other options instead. Whenever we are on any project like commercial lighting repairs or new installations, our clients can get updates on their jobs both via the internet and by calling our client services desk.</p>
