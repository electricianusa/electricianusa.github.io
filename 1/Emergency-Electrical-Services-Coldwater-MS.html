<h2>Whole Home Backup Generators Coldwater Mississippi</h2>
<p>The main benefit of a standby whole house generator installation is that they will power your house for days after a power outage.

<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage. Typically when I see a switch wired from a receptacle box the switch is being used to make one of the receptacles switchable while leaving the others always -on.</p>
