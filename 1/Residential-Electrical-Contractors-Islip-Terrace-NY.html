The technician may check the voltage of the unit's electrical components and tighten connections. In most states, you only need a high school Diploma to apply for an apprentice license, and you don't need any electrical training to qualify for it. Once you receive your apprentice license, you can apply for an apprenticeship under a licensed electrician.</p>
<p>PLEASE turn OFF the power at the fuse box or circuit breaker before you begin installation. If you notice that the switch seems to be reversed i.e. the switch indicates ‘on' but the light is off and if the switch indicates ‘off' but the light is on, then you have incorrectly wired the switch and it will have to be redone properly. This is because the typical modern family uses more electrical appliances and devices than a family — let's say — 20 to 30 years ago.</p>
