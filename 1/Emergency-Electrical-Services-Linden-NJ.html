This wiring option isn't complicated by any means; it's just a bit more involved than plug-and-play connectors as it requires the use of wire cutters and strippers to tie into your main landscape line. We have been serving the Raleigh , Durham Apex , Cary , Chapel Hill , Morrisville , and Garner communities with emergency electrical service calls for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>This involves determining the specific locations of each light and its outdoor power source. This is not to be confused with tinned copper wiring which has a dull silver finish, but this was used in a much earlier time. If your home wiring circuits are not so identified, the time required to make up such a record will be saved many times over as fuse replacements, fixture alterations and other repairs become necessary. Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>

Information on the following pages includes important safety information and tips to follow for safely using electrical appliances and being safe around electricity.

After completing this course, participants should be able to describe the basic construction and operation of direct current (DC) motors, alternating current (AC) induction motors, and AC synchronous motors. Lenses and grates can be easily installed on these fixtures for many custom lighting applications.</p>
<p>When you trip” the breaker this refers to the action of your circuit breaker doing the job it was intended to do. If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them. That's why a recent, first-of-its-kind study from the Fire Protection Research Foundation carefully examined electrical risks and hazards present in older homes.</p>
