<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians.

<p>Much care is taken so that established root systems, trees , shrubs and plants are not damaged during lighting system installation. Certificate programs may focus solely on residential electrician work, while associate's degree programs are broader and usually require some general education courses as well. However, a good general rule is that the final installed cost is usually twice the price of the generator.
