But the low-voltage wiring on the low voltage secondary wiring that is operated by wall switches and used to control 120V devices may itself be un fused.</p>
<p>The same thing occurs in industry, a fuse in a circuit blows and the maintenance person gets the replacement fuse and inserts it into the fuseholder. It does add additional cost to the installation of the generator, but the peace of mind provided may be what your situation needs. Even though new NEC Article 411 was developed to cover the new low-voltage track lighting, low-voltage landscape lighting is also covered by default since they are designed and listed systems.</p>
