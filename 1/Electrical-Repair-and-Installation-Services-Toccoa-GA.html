Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth. The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>The purpose of electrical wiring is to efficiently and safely carry electricity from where it is generated to where it is consumed. Being licensed means that an exam has been passed and the necessary qualifications to do the work is guaranteed. Lastly, remove the ground wire from the green screw. Use extension cords or equipment that is rated for the level of amperage or wattage that you are using. Our electricians are true professionals.
