More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps.

Instead, electricity flows from the transformer terminal into your house and electronics and back again by way of continuous wire paths between them.</p>
