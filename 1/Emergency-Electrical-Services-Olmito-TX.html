After removing the door or panel, you'll find the removable filter mounted under the blower motor; slide it out and check the wording on the filter's edges to see whether it should be cleaned or replaced with a new filter.</p>
<p>A Class A Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) works by detecting any loss of electrical current in a circuit (e.g., it will trip at a maximum of 6mA).
