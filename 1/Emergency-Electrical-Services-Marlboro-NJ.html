<p>An electrical and electronic installer is responsible for testing, operating and repair of equipment and tools that make use of electronic technology. This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring. Note: most states require a certain percentage of electrician training hours be spent in commercial or industrial installation. Low-voltage electrical system switches originally made by GE® or Remcon can be replaced with newer ones from Touch Plate but with some provisos which we explain below. Needless to say, a home standby generator will give you power when you need it most.</p>

<p>The electrical code requires you to have GFCI outlets installed in bathrooms, kitchens, and outdoor areas because these areas often get wet. The condition of cables and wires deteriorates over time. In addition, the rise of alternative energy systems like solar power means more growth in the need for electricians. Like anything in your home, however, breakers and fuses need to be repaired or replaced over time. These are hooked to your home's electrical system and directly take the required natural gas or propane fuel from your city's pipelines.</p>
<p>After completing this course, participants should be able to determine current and voltage values for an AC sine wave; explain how resistance, inductance, and capacitance affect AC circuits; explain how to calculate power in AC circuits and how to adjust power by correctly selecting and sizing circuit components; and describe the construction, operation, and use of various types of transformers.
