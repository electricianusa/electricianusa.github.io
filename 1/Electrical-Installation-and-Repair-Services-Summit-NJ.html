<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Summit</h2>
<p>When your business depends on electrical machinery and equipment for increased productivity and improved cash flow, it is extremely important to keep that machinery inspected and well-maintained on a regular basis. It is also possible that your home is of more recent construction and the switch has a neutral in the box as required by code, but is not connected to anything.

Or you could remove the wires from the switch and tie those two together, bypassing the switch.
