<p>There are many different types of electricians out there, each requiring different types of electrician licenses and training programs.

<p>We have low prices every day on quality lighting along with landscape light installation kits, transformers, posts, rock guards and other parts you'll need.

<p>A generator works best as a standby source of electricity in case of emergencies and power outages. Bi-fuel generators can use both diesel and natural gas, offering a high level of flexibility. During a power outage, Kohler generators provide immediate power to your home or business, for as long as you need it. When John Michael Kohler founded his company in 1873, he had no way of knowing the positive impact his powerful products would have on people for generations to come.</p>
<p>Standby generators are much more complicated than portable ones and require professional installation as they tie into gas and other utility lines and usually require special permits. The first things you need to know about your house electrical wire are the basics. Whole home generators range anywhere from $3,000 to up to $15,000 depending on the specific unit and fuel source. If you are having a problem and you reset the breaker, but it will not remain that way, or it does not restore power, chances are there is a problem with the electrical panel.</p>
