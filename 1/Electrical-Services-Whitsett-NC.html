So, now that you know what type of switch you have, you can go to the store to get that you have a three-way switch, two the terminals are the same color, you will also have two wires coming from that old switch that you need to put on the same side and you will have a third wire that is a different color that will go on the darker colored terminal and again you have your ground terminal and that is where the green wire or bare wire goes.A couple of reasons you may need to replace your outlet.</p>

<p>Electrical wiring problems can potentially cause serious fire and electrocution hazards, so it's better not to take a chance if there is any question in your mind about safety. Avoid overloading extension cords, sockets and plugs. If you do not have an electrical outlet outside your house, then you will have to pay to have one put in. If the location where you want your low voltage lights is some distance from the outlet, then you will need to purchase additional wiring and bury it. All of this is a hassle that is easily avoided by choosing outdoor solar lights instead of the low voltage garden lights.</p>
