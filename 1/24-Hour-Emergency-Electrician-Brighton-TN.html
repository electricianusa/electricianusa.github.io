<p>Electrical wiring for a new log home is always a thing that worries owners. In most cases, this will provide you with enough coverage to keep your most important appliances running, such as your refrigerator, but it will not power not your entire home.

That's why a recent, first-of-its-kind study from the Fire Protection Research Foundation carefully examined electrical risks and hazards present in older homes.</p>
