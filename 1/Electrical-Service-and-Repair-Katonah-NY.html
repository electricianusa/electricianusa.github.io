<p>I believe that's how it was, and yes the switch works in its updated function of controlling the ceiling lights. More than 2,000 children are in emergency rooms due to electrical burns or shocks each year. For example, let's say you have a circuit with wiring rated to handle 15 amps.

Most homes will have a few outdoor electrical sockets, but if you have one that is too far away from your light fixtures, you may need to call in a professional electrician to wire one closer for you. When installing wiring, electricians use handtools such as conduit benders, screwdrivers, pliers, knives, hacksaws, and wire strippers, as well as power tools such as drills and saws.</p>
<p>They are safe, quiet, and convenient (there's no need to worry about refueling or high costs of using diesel or natural gas).
