<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Franklin Park</h2>
<p>Ron Cowgill shows you how to install a regular light switch, a three way switch, a dimmer switch, a receptacle and GFCI receptacle.

<p>Electrical contracting services for residential and commercial clients. Electricians know that glossing over details in a wiring project could at best result in non-functioning wiring, and at worst create a dangerous situation. A lightning surge protection device creates a barrier that prevents electricity from spiking suddenly during a storm. In addition, everything is already there to run another device, whether an outlet, light or something else, if need be. In the past, too many people have used the ground wire as a neutral, which may work but is not safe.</p>
