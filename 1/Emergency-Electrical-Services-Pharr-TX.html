As the Bay Area continues to deal with PG&E cutting power on short notice, the value of a backup generator will increase to potential buyers.</p>
<p>However, in some situations, it will be necessary for you to upgrade your electric panel to a more advanced system. For instance, LED bulbs do a better job of mimicking natural light than other bulbs, which makes your home feel more inviting and easier on the eyes. Once that's done, turn the power back on to the outlet and carefully place the voltage tester near each wire.

Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time. If an appliance falls into a filled tub or sink, or if you touch an electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water, you risk severe electrical shock and possibly death. Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
