Working as anelectrician is one of the best jobs you can secure with only a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>
<p>If one or more of the phases is missing, disconnect the primary voltage source (incoming power disconnect switch) and replace the incoming power fuses or reset the motor-control circuit breaker. That way the second outlet can be switched while leaving the GFI on at all times.
