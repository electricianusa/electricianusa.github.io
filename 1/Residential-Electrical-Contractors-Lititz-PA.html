<p>Although single motors and single controllers are sometimes used in isolated applications, the more usual application is one in which many motors and many controllers are interlinked into a larger automated system that includes many types of processes. For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it. Obviously then, the larger the number, the greater the amount of protection the device can offer.</p>
