<p>Storms and severe weather have always posed a threat to our electrical systems, but infrastructure is beginning to age. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, then you'll want to look for fixtures labeled: "hard-wire" or "direct-wire", and unless your kitchen is already set up for these fixtures, you will need an electrician to install new wiring and a switch or dimmer to control the lights. If you live in an older home or if your house doesn't have proper wiring, it can cause a power surge.</p>
