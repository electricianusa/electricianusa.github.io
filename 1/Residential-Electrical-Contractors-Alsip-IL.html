The more power you use, and the longer runtime the generator needs to provide it, the more fuel you need.</p>
<p>Since short circuits have such damaging impacts on electrical equipment, their impact on the components in the circuit must be purpose of this course is to explain how the various protective devices react to faulted conditions and how to select the appropriate devices to ensure proper coordination.
