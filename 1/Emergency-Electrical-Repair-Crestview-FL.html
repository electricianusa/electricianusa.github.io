<p>To stay within a 0.5 to 1.0 volt differential between the first light and the last fixture on a given circuit, you must group the fixtures into distance zones and not overload the cable with excessive wattage. I will be upgrading the electrical panel in my home from 100 to 200 amps. In older homes, outdated electrical work may not be up to code, and today's greater electrical needs can result in overloaded circuits. The best solution is to have a standby generator system installed.</p>

High voltage power may be run to a central driver location ideally, within 50 feet of wire length from lighting, depending on the system and wire types), and then all wiring downstream of the drivers may be Class 2.
