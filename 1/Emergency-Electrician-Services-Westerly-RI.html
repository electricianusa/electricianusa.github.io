<p>Our team at All Pro Plumbing, Heating, Air & Electrical is committed to making sure your home or commercial electrical system is safe and efficient for the safety of those you love.

<p>No touching electrical appliances without permission - this includes kitchen appliances and dad's power tools, which should all be locked away when not in use. An automatic backup generator helps prevent problems like food spoilage and flooding by ensuring that your home's critical devices (such as the refrigerator and sump pump) maintain power. If you are experiencing frequently tripped circuit breakers, it may be time for a panel upgrade to allow for more electricity.</p>
