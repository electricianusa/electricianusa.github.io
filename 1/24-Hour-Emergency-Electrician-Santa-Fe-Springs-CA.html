<p>Permanently installed generators run on either natural gas or propane. The size of the generator you need is directly related to the appliances you want to keep power running to. If you just needed a fridge to have power, the size of the generator would be much smaller. Connected to your LP or natural gas fuel supply, the backup generator kicks in within seconds of determining a power loss and can run as long as it takes for your utility power to turn back on.</p>
<p>Standby generators are much more complicated than portable ones and require professional installation as they tie into gas and other utility lines and usually require special permits. The first things you need to know about your house electrical wire are the basics. Whole home generators range anywhere from $3,000 to up to $15,000 depending on the specific unit and fuel source. If you are having a problem and you reset the breaker, but it will not remain that way, or it does not restore power, chances are there is a problem with the electrical panel.</p>
