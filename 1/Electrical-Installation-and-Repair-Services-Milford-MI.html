<p>If the ceiling lights dim when you turn on a microwave or vacuum cleaner , you may be overloading the circuits or the wiring. Yanking can damage or fray the cord and compromise electrical safety.

Some of the new L.E.D. landscaping lights are amazing. Be careful not to overload one surge protector with equipment that uses a lot of energy; divide the load between several surge protectors.</p>
