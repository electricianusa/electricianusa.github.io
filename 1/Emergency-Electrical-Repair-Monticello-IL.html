It's basically going to cap the output at a certain wattage or voltage of electricity and return any unwanted electricity back into the home circuit loop. The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of.

If you're constantly tripping breakers then it might be time for an electrical inspection so the reason can be determined and the circuit breakers either replaced or upgraded to better handle the electrical load being placed on them. That's why a recent, first-of-its-kind study from the Fire Protection Research Foundation carefully examined electrical risks and hazards present in older homes.</p>
