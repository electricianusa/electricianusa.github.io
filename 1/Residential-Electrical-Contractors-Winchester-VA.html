Regular maintenance ensures your generator will never fail to operate as issues such as broken parts, electric malfunctions, and wear and tear as a result of age and usage, can be identified and fixed before they become a problem. LED bulbs can last up to 30 years, where standard bulbs need to be replaced every year or so. Furthermore, because LED fixtures are smaller, they allow for lighting designs which previously may have been impossible due to the limitations of standard systems.</p>
<p>When wiring standard switches, the wires connected to the switch are both hot. The electrical panel in your home can go for years without the need for any upgrades or replacements.
