<h3>Tips for Hiring Electrical Maintenance Service in Mission KS</h3>
<p>9. Measure voltage on 3-phase Wye and Delta connected circuits and calculate percent phase imbalance as part of troubleshooting motors. Two thousand hours credit may be granted for a graduate of a two-year electrical school accepted by the board. Too many times a homeowner will use the uninsulated ground wire as a neutral to accomplish what they want, and the result is an ungrounded circuit where there should never be one. Today we're going to be focusing on surge protection.</p>
<p>This means that although it is safer to work on the doorbell than the regular household electrical system, I always advise DIY's to turn off the power to the system they want to work on. This may be difficult because outlet wires may be crammed into the box. The live feed from the distribution board connects to the terminal marked ‘common' in the double pole switch while the wire from the neutral terminal runs to the second double pole switch via a separate 3 wire cable.</p>
<p>Circuits are not designed to house two conductors, and one may come loose, overheat, arc, or even lead to a fire.
