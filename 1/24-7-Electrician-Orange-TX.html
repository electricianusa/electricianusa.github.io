<p>They are easy to build or install, safe to operate, affordable and will supply enough electricity to operate your entire home.

<p>The standby generator and the transfer switch are installed by a professional to the home's existing electrical wiring. When you call our 24-hour emergency electrical service, you will talk to a licensed electrician who will ask you a few questions about your residential problem and dispatch an emergency electrician as soon as possible.
