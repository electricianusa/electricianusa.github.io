There will also be one large switch, usually at the top of the panel; this is the main circuit breaker, and it controls power flow to the entire electric panel. When homeowners start experiencing flickering lights and can feel heat coming the panel, it is time to call an electrician for an upgrade. Homeowners can invest in a home standby air-cooled generator size that used to only be available in much more expensive, liquid-cooled models, giving them the lowest cost per kilowatt available.</p>
