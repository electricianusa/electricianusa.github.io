<p>Similarly, if your breaker panel is malfunctioning, so will the electronic devices and appliances in your home. If you were planning to power everything listed above then, at first glance, you might think that you're going to need a 30,000 watt generator. If you have an older home (built before 1965) and and its electrical system hasn't been upgraded, there's a chance that it still has a 60-amp fuse box.
