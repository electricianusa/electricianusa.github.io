<p>We are trusted daily to complete projects by putting the best tools in the hands of the best people.

<p>If you find that you have one particular circuit that seems to inexplicably shut off, even with no significant electrical load on it, then you may need to replace a faulty breaker. Always best to disconnect power, but issues of insulation failure, lack of proper grounding, lack of GFCI, out-of-code wiring, generator operating without transfer switch, and other problems pose a risk to anyone working on electric power. Licensed electrician requirements also dictate proper insurance coverage - including Worker's Compensation, liability, and property damage.</p>
<p>Install the landscape lights in beds, and use in-ground well lights for the yard. Place all the lights in their correct places then begin installing them. Water and electricity can be lethal so it is more important to maintain electrical safety in the kitchen and bathroom.

If you see someone enter an electrical substation that should not be there, call the authorities and Vera Water and Power.</p>

<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage. Typically when I see a switch wired from a receptacle box the switch is being used to make one of the receptacles switchable while leaving the others always -on.</p>
