Like anything in your home, however, breakers and fuses need to be repaired or replaced over time. These are hooked to your home's electrical system and directly take the required natural gas or propane fuel from your city's pipelines.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage.
