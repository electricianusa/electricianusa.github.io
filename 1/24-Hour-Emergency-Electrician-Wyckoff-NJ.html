You can't just plug in the TV — there's the TV and the receiver and the Roku and whatever else.” The group resorted to plugging power strips and extension cords into virtually every outlet.

<p>Purchasing a transformer with a higher maximum wattage capacity will come in handy if you want to add more lights later.
