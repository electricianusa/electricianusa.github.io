<p>Although it's an electrical application, low voltage lighting takes very little energy to run and is relatively safe. Keep electrical cords out of the way. If your property doesn't have an exterior ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet, essential for powering a low voltage lighting system, a licensed electrician will have to add one, which will add to the expense.

<p>A plus for running propane over NG is that you will get the full 20KW out of the genset rather than a 20% reduction (e.g. 18KW) using NG.

Breakers Won't Remain Reset: If you notice that a reset circuit breaker in your electrical panel won't stay reset or restore power, then it's very likely that you have a faulty service panel.</p>

Today we're going to be focusing on surge protection.</p>
<p>Brint Electric is dedicated to helping those customers in need by providing commercial and industrial emergency electrical service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If there is no neutral wire in the switch box, such as in the diagram at the top of this page, you likely cannot use a smart switch.
