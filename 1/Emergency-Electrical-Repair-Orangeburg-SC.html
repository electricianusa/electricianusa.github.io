To control speed and light levels without significant rewiring, however, you can use a remote switch. We understand that emergency electrical problems happen at often inconvenient times for you and your family.

On an ungrounded electrical circuit you should install only two-prong, ungrounded receptacles - that is code compliant and that also lets users know that there is no reliable electrical ground present. Some of the new L.E.D. landscaping lights are amazing. Be careful not to overload one surge protector with equipment that uses a lot of energy; divide the load between several surge protectors.</p>
