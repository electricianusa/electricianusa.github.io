So, sizing generators isn't as simple as saying, If your home has this many sq. ft., then you must get this size generator.” It's slightly more complex than that, and an experienced electrician will calculate your home's anticipated electrical loads and recommend the right size generator.</p>

A standby generator, or automatic standby generator , is a type of system that turns on whenever you lose power, rather than waiting for you to hit the switch.
