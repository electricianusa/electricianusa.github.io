That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code. Some homeowners want the generator installed in a garage since there is already a concrete floor and the unit will be out of the weather and safe from thieves.</p>
<p>The Power Meter: The power meter, sometimes referred to as the energy meter, or electricity reader, is either located on the electrical panel itself, or somewhere near it. This measures the property's use of electricity, in a unit of measurement called a kilowatt hour (kWh). If you're noticing minor rust on your breaker panel's housing, have it inspected by an electrician. Electrical problems are among the leading causes of home fires in the United States alone.</p>

<p>Much care is taken so that established root systems, trees , shrubs and plants are not damaged during lighting system installation.
