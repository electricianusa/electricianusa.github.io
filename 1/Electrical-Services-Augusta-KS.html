This powering system has an engine and runs off of LP or natural gas. If there is, take the wires off the switch and splice them together, along with a short jumper back to the switch.

<p>They require professional installation and either a natural gas or liquid propane fuel source. Low-voltage lighting is versatile because you can mix any fixture types you want along the same transformer line, from patio wall lights to walkway lights.
